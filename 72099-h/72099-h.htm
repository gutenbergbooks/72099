<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>Many Americans are interested in the Eighteenth
Amendment. Millions are interested in the
American citizen.</p>

<p>It seems not to be known that the existence of one
flatly denies the existence of the other. This is not
theory. It is plain statement of a very simple fact. If
there is an American citizen, the Amendment never
entered the Constitution. On the contrary, if the
Amendment is in the Constitution, there never has been
an America or an American citizen.</p>

<p>Throughout this book the nation of free men is
called “America.” This is done to distinguish the nation
from the federation of states already existing and
known as the United States, when the whole American
people created the nation and continued the federation
as a subordinate part of one system of government.
The federation of states was proposed in 1777 and
had complete existence in 1781. The nation of men
was created in 1788.</p>

<p>On January 14, 1922, there was opened at Williamsburg,
Virginia, the Marshall-Wythe School of
Government and Citizenship. Judge Alton B. Parker,
former Chief Justice of the New York Court of Appeals
and a former candidate for President, delivered
the opening address on “American Constitutional Government.”
His eloquent address has since been made
a public document and printed in the <i>Congressional
Record</i>. In it, he warned us of the danger to America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
from those who do not understand our form of government
and are coming here to destroy it.</p>

<p>“As people of this class have been coming to us in
large numbers from nearly every quarter of the globe,
we must take up the task of so educating all classes of
our vast population, as that they shall fully understand
the importance of maintaining, in its integrity, our constitutional
plan of government. They should be taught
in the first instance, why it was that the people, in the
formative period of our government, were bound to
have, and did at last secure, a government which the
people could control despite their legislatures, whether
representing the states or the federal government.”</p>

<p>The existence of the Eighteenth Amendment is
based on the sheer assumption that we have not a
government of that kind. By all who have discussed
the Amendment, whether for or against it, one false
assumption has been made. From that false assumption
of all, the advocates of the Amendment have
drawn their conclusion. On the conclusion is based the
existence of the Amendment. The conclusion itself is
the direct negation of the simplest and most important
fact in America. Moreover, the conclusion itself
means that the Americans, twelve years after they “did
at last secure” the kind of government they “were
bound to have” and of which Judge Parker spoke,
voluntarily created a “government” of the opposite
kind and made themselves its absolute “subjects.”</p>

<p>And the conclusion is correct, if the premise, which
is the false assumption of all, be true.</p>

<p>Of course, the assumption is absolutely untrue. But
no one has seen its simple and patent untruth. Wherefore,
the first step in our education is for us to acquire
knowledge of the plain fact that it is untrue. Because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
our leaders do not know the fact, we must go to other
teachers.</p>

<p>By the common false assumption, the early Americans—who
“did at last secure” the kind of government
they “were bound to have”—are now charged with
having committed the most monumental blunder in all
history, a blunder which destroyed their entire achievement.</p>

<p>Rest assured! They did not commit that blunder.
They themselves make that clear herein. In so doing,
they teach us what, with Judge Parker, we agree that
we all must know, if America and the American citizen
are to remain. They are the best teachers in the world.
They know what they teach because they did it. They
do not weary or perplex us with theories or principles.
Their teaching is the telling of simple facts. Best of
all, they tell us in their own simple words, while they
are talking to one another and engaged in the very
accomplishment of the facts they teach.</p>

<p>It is a mere incident of their teaching that they
settle the plain fact that the supposed Eighteenth
Amendment is not in the Constitution.</p>

<p>It is our own candid belief that very few Americans
will be found to prefer the existence of the Amendment
to the existence of America itself. The early Americans
make amazingly clear that there is no America
and no American citizen if the Amendment is in the
Constitution.</p>

<p>The nation of men, which we call America, and the
subordinate federation of states, which we call the
United States, are bound together in one dual system.
They have a common name, “The United States of
America.” They have a common Constitution, with
national Articles for the men and federal Articles for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
the states. They have a common government, national
for the men and federal for the states.</p>

<p>This is exactly the America of which Judge Parker
spoke. We want to keep it. The early Americans,
who made it, will enable us to keep it, if we listen to
their teaching of the simple facts which they accomplished.
Such a result would be some credit to the
supposed Eighteenth Amendment. Even those most
opposed to it would be compelled to acknowledge that
its brief imaginary existence awoke us all to our first
real concept of what America, the nation of free men,
really is.</p>

Education of personal experience, from 1775 to 1790, accurately

“legislatures” may act constitutionally in making future federal
Articles—Recognize its constitutional mode as exact Revolutionary
mode just followed by Madison and others at Philadelphia
and that future Congress should do exactly what Philadelphia
did and no more—Recognize Fifth Article settles how each “convention”
vote shall count as one vote of American citizens and
how many “convention” votes shall be necessary and sufficient to
make a future Article which “conventions” of American citizens
alone can make—Recognize words “in three-fourths thereof” after

insist on the Tenth Amendment declaration that all other power
of that kind is reserved by themselves to themselves—“In their
hands it remains secure. They can delegate it in such proportions,
to such bodies, at such times, and under such limitations,
as they think proper”—In 1907, the Supreme Court states, what
the “conventions” knew, that all powers not granted in the First
Article are reserved to the “conventions” of American citizens
“and can be exercised only by them or on further grant from
them”—The “conventions,” having secured the liberty of American

held, the first ten Amendments merely declared what was already
in Constitution—A relevant and important declaration in the
Tenth is that the entire Constitution gives no power of any kind
to state legislatures—Amazing modern Tory concept that these
ten Amendments are an American Magna Charta or compact
between a master government and its “subjects”—Madison and
Supreme Court on the “impious doctrine” that Americans are
“subjects”—Eleventh and Twelfth Amendments have naught to
do with individual freedom—Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth
neither exercise nor create government power to interfere with
human liberty—On the contrary, their purpose and effect are to
make human liberty universal—Sixteenth removes a federal limitation,
in favor of the states, from a power the “conventions”
gave to Congress—Seventeenth relates only to the election of
Senators—When 1917 opens, Congress has no power to interfere
with individual liberty of American citizens which Congress did
not have in 1790—When 1917 opens, no legislatures, since July
4, 1776, have dared to interfere with the individual liberty of the
American citizens outside the First Article grants or have dared
to attempt to create a new power so to interfere—When 1917

December, 1917, closing month of America’s first year in World War
for human liberty—American citizens have but one government,
Congress, which can interfere with their human liberty in any
matter—Congress knows it cannot interfere by making the command
which is Section 1 of the Eighteenth Amendment—Amazing
Resolution in Senate that legislative governments of state
citizens be asked directly to interfere with human liberty of
American citizen in matter not enumerated in First Article—Resolution
asks some state governments to give only American
government a new enumerated power to interfere with freedom
of American citizen, the first new power of that kind since June
21, 1788—Some leaders question “wisdom” of Resolution—No
leader questions power of any governments (except Congress in
the enumerated First Article matters) to interfere with freedom
of American citizen—No leader questions power of any or all
governments to give a new enumerated power of that kind to
the only American government or to any government—No leader
knows that, in 1917 as in 1787 and in 1790, only the “conventions”
of American citizens can make the command or the grant
of power—House of Representatives adds absurdity to absurdity—Adds
to Resolution that state governments, while interfering
with liberty of American citizen and granting only American
government first new enumerated power so to interfere, should
also give themselves (the granting governments) the very power
they assume to exercise over American citizens—Webb, explaining
to the House his proposed change in Section 2 of the Amendment,
states this to be the meaning and purpose of the change—Article
IV contrasted with absurd modern error, as to meaning
of Article V—That modern error is sole basis of Tory concept
that any or all governments could make Articles like First
Article or supposed Eighteenth Amendment—Article IV guarantees
to citizens of each state that their state government shall be
republican, getting from them its every power to interfere with
their individual freedom—Senate Resolution asks state governments,
outside each state, to give each state government power
to interfere with the freedom of its own citizens—Congress of
1917 acted on assumption that Article V meant to enable Congress
to suggest any desired breach of the guarantee in the
closing words of Article IV.

Congress—Concept of latter merely repeats mistake of government
counsel on which Supreme Court dwelt with emphasis in
1907—Ignores most important factor in Tenth Amendment, “people”
or “conventions”—From the early Americans, “Who but the
people can delegate powers? What have the state governments
to do with it?” and “How comes it, sir, that these state governments
dictate to their superiors—to the majesty of the people?”—Webb
reads to the House a Fifth Article in which “conventions”
does not appear—Madison tells Webb and all of his Tory
concept, “These gentlemen must here be reminded of their error.
They must be told that the ultimate authority resides in the people
alone, and that it will not depend merely on the comparative
ambition or address of the different governments, whether either,
or which of them, will be able to enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction
at the expense of the other”—Webb closes in the House with

words, the Supreme Court statement of the fact that
“conventions” of the people, not states or their governments, made
the Constitution with its First Article grants of power to interfere

America, giving their only American government its enumerated
powers, gave it no power to interfere with the human right mentioned
in the new Amendment—Human rights never are privileges
of citizens—Citizens establish government to protect existing
human rights—Only “subjects” get any rights or privileges from

the French aristocrats, before French Revolution, nor
Tories of 1776 in England or America knew them—Eighteenth
Amendment Tories do not know them—Madison (in 1789) and
Supreme Court (in 1890) knew that commodities named in new
Amendment are among those in which a human right “of traffic
exists”—In litigations of 1920, no counsel appear on behalf of
the human rights of American citizens—But we know that no

<p>The average American of this generation does not
understand what it means to be a citizen of America.
He does not know the relation of such a citizen
to all governments <i>in</i> America. He does not know the
relations of those governments to one another. If
this ignorance should continue, the citizen of America
would disappear. The American would become again
a subject, as he was when the year 1776 opened.</p>

<p>The supposed Eighteenth Amendment is not in the
Constitution unless the American already is a subject.</p>

<p>It is vital to every individual interest of the average
American that he <i>should</i> know these things which he
does not know. Happily for him, <i>his</i> ignorance is not
as that of the public leaders of his generation. <i>Their</i>
concept of the American and his relation to governments
in America is one which contradicts the most
definitely settled and clearly stated American law. On
the other hand, the average American merely has a
mind which is a blank page in these matters. As a
result, it is the greatest danger to his individual interest
that <i>their</i> concept largely guides his attitude in
public affairs of the utmost moment to him.</p>

<p>The Americans of an earlier generation, who created
the American nation of men and all governments <i>in</i>
America, accurately knew the status of the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
citizen and his relation to all governments. Their
accurate knowledge was an insistent thing which guided
their every act as a people in the period between 1775
and 1790, in which latter year the last of the Americans
became citizens of America. Their knowledge
came to them from their own personal experience in
those fifteen years. They were a people, born subjects
of government, who died citizens of a great nation and
whose every government, <i>in</i> America, was their servant.
This great miracle they themselves had wrought
in the fifteen years between 1775 and 1790. Their
greatest achievement, as the discerning mind has always
realized, is what they did in the last four of those
momentous years. They brought to its doing their
valuable experience and training of the previous eleven
years. That is why they succeeded, so far as human
effort can secure human liberty by means of written
constitutions of government, in securing to themselves
and their posterity the utmost measure of protected
enjoyment of human life and happiness. That we,
their posterity, may keep their legacy intact and transmit
it to the generations to come, it is necessary that
we, the average Americans, should share somewhat
with them their amazingly accurate knowledge of the
simple but vital facts which enabled them to create
a nation and, by its American Constitution, to secure
to themselves, its citizens, protected enjoyment of life,
liberty and happiness.</p>

<p>When they were actually engaged in this work of
creation, it was truthfully said of them that “The
American people are better acquainted with the science
of government than any other people in the world.”
For over a hundred years the history of America attested
the truth of that statement. As they were a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
simple people, their knowledge of the science of government
was derived from their accurate understanding
of a few simple facts. It is a certainty that we
can keep their legacy by learning those same facts. Let
us quickly learn them. The accurate knowledge of
them may best be acquired by briefly living again, with
those simple Americans of an earlier generation,
through their days from 1775 to 1790.</p>

<p>The individual Americans of that generation were
all born subjects of the British government. We do
not understand the meaning of that statement until we
accurately grasp the vital distinction between a “subject”
of a government and a “citizen” of a nation.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to point out, but it is amazingly
important to remember, that a “subject,” as well
as a “citizen,” is first of all a human being, created
by an omnipotent Creator and endowed with human
rights. All would be well with the world, if each
human being always accurately knew the difference
between right and wrong and if his accurate knowledge
invariably controlled his exercise of his human freedom
of will. In that case, no human government would be
needed to prescribe and to enforce rules of personal
conduct for the individual. As such is not the case,
human government must exist. Its sole reason for
existence, therefore, is that it may prescribe and enforce
rules for those whom it can compel to obey its
commands and that it may thus secure the utmost
measure of protected enjoyment of human rights for
those human beings whose government it is.</p>

<p>Time does not permit and necessity does not require
that we dwell upon the various types of government
which have existed or which have been created
supposedly to meet this human need. It is sufficient to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
grasp the simple and important fact that government
ability to say what men may or may not do, in any
matter which is exercise of human freedom, is the very
essence of government. Where a government has no
ability <i>of that kind, except</i> what the men of its nation
grant to it, where those men limit and determine the
extent of that ability in their government, the men
themselves are citizens. Where a government claims
or exercises any ability <i>of that kind</i>, and has not received
the grant of it directly from the men of the
nation, where a government claims or exercises any
ability <i>of that kind</i>, without any grant of it, or by grant
<i>from</i> government <i>to</i> government, the men of that nation
are subjects.</p>

<p>In the year 1775, under the British law, the Parliament
at Westminster claimed the unqualified right to
determine in what matters and to what extent laws
should be made which would interfere with individual
freedom. From such decision of the legislative part
of the British Government there was no appeal save
by force or revolution. For this reason, that every
human being under that Government must submit to
any interference with individual freedom commanded
by that Legislature, all British human beings were
“subjects.” And, as all Americans were then under
that British Government, all Americans were then
“subjects.” Such was their legal status under the so-called
British Constitution. Curiously enough, however,
until a comparatively short time prior to 1775,
such had <i>not</i> been the <i>actual</i> status of the Americans.
In this sharp contrast between their legal and their
actual status, there will be found both the cause of
their Revolution and the source of their great and
accurate knowledge of the sound principles of republican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
government which they later made the fundamental
law of America.</p>

<p>From the day their ancestors had first been British
colonists in America their legal status had been that of
subjects of the British Government. But, so long as
they remained merely a few widely scattered sets of
human beings in a new world, struggling to get a bare
existence from day to day, they offered no temptation
to the omnipotent British Government to oppress them,
its subjects. They still had to show the signs of acquiring
that community wealth which has always been the
temptation of government to unjust exaction from the
human beings it governs. For that reason, their legal
government concerned itself very little about them or
their welfare. It thus became their necessity to govern
themselves for all the purposes for which they locally
needed government as security to their individual welfare.</p>

<p>Only thirteen years after the first permanent English
settlement in Virginia, “Sir George Yeardley, then the
Governor of the colony, in 1619 called a general assembly,
composed of representatives from the various plantations
in the colony, and permitted them to assume and
exercise the high functions of legislation. Thus was
formed and established the first representative legislature
that ever sat in America. And this example of a
domestic parliament, to regulate all the internal concerns
of the country, was never lost sight of, but was
ever afterwards cherished [until 1917] throughout
America, as the dearest birthright of freemen.” (1
<i>Ell. Deb.</i> 22.)</p>

<p>“On the 11th of November, 1620, those humble but
fearless adventurers, the Plymouth colonists, before
their landing, drew up and signed an original compact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
in which, after acknowledging themselves subjects of
the crown of England, they proceed to declare: ‘Having
undertaken, for the glory of God, and the advancement
of the Christian faith, and the honor of our king
and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the
northern parts of Virginia, we do, by these presents,
solemnly and mutually, in the presence of God and of
one another, covenant and combine ourselves together
into a civil body politic, for our better ordering and
preservation, and furtherance of the ends aforesaid.
And by virtue hereof do enact, constitute, and frame,
such just and equal laws, ordinances, acts, constitutions,
and officers, from time to time, as shall be thought most
meet and convenient for the general good of the colony;
unto which we promise all due submission and obedience.’
This is the whole of the compact, and it was
signed by forty-one persons.</p>

<p>“It is, in its very essence, a pure democracy; and, in
pursuance of it, the colonists proceeded soon afterwards
to organize the colonial government, under the name
of the Colony of New Plymouth, to appoint a Governor
and other officers and to enact laws. The Governor
was chosen annually by the freemen, and had at first
one assistant to aid him in the discharge of his trust.
Four others were soon afterwards added, and finally
the number was increased to seven. The supreme
legislative power resided in, and was exercised by, the
whole body of the male inhabitants, every freeman,
who was a member of the church, being admitted to
vote in all public affairs. The number of settlements
having increased, and being at a considerable distance
from each other, a house of representatives was established
in 1639, the members of which, as well as all
other officers, were annually chosen.” (1 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 25.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>These are two examples typical of the way in which
the English colonists, for the first hundred years,
largely governed themselves by legislators chosen from
among themselves. In this manner, while legally “subjects”
of their European government, these Americans
were actually “citizens” of their respective communities,
actually governed in their individual lives and
liberties by governments which derived all their powers
of government from these “citizens.” In this manner,
through the best teacher in the world, personal experience,
they learned the vital difference between the relation
of “subject” and “citizen” to governments. Later,
the echo of that education was heard from Lincoln
when he pleaded that government <i>of</i> the people, <i>by</i>
the people and <i>for</i> them should not perish from the
earth.</p>

<p>As early as 1754 these Americans began to feel the
first real burden of their legal status as “subjects.”
Their community wealth was beginning to attract the
attention of the world. As a result, the legal Government
awoke to the fact of their existence and of its own
omnipotent ability to levy upon that wealth. The
Americans, for more than a century educated in actual
self-government, quickly showed the result of that education
to the accurate knowledge that no government
can have any just power except by the consent or grant
of those to be governed by the exercise of such power.
As far back as 1754, deputies of the various American
colonies, where human beings had educated themselves
to be free men, assembled at Albany in an endeavor
to propose some compromise by which the American
people would be enabled to preserve their human freedom
against unjust interference by the Westminster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Legislature. We are all familiar with the failure of
that endeavor. We are all familiar with the successive
steps of the continuing struggle between “subjects,”
educated to be “citizens,” and an omnipotent government,
unshaken in its purpose to make their actual
status the same as their legal one.</p>

<p>When the year 1776 dawned, these Americans were
still “subjects” under the law of the British Empire.
They were, however, “subjects” in open rebellion
against their government, justifying their rebellion on
the basic American legal principle that every just
power, even of a lawful government, must be derived
from the consent or grant of the human beings themselves
who are to be governed. On the memorable
day in July of that year, despairing of any success in
getting the British Government to recognize that
basic principle, and asserting, for the first time in history,
that they themselves were collectively the possessors
of the supreme human will in and for America,
they enacted the immortal Statute which we know as
the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Declaration of Independence, <i>which was the first
political act of the American people in their independent
sovereign capacity</i>, lays the foundation of our national existence
upon this broad proposition: “That all men are
created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” (Justice Bradley’s
opinion in Slaughter House Cases, 16 <i>Wall.</i> 36, at page
115.)</p>
</div>

<p>In this Statute, the American people clearly stated
and definitely settled for all time the basic legal principle
on which rests the validity of every constitutional
article or statute law, which either directly interferes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
or vests ability in governments to interfere with an
American in the exercise of his human freedom. There
is nothing vague or ambiguous in their statement. The
legal principle, so clearly stated and so definitely settled,
is that no government in America can have any
just power of direct interference with individual freedom
unless such power be derived by direct grant from
the Americans to be governed by the exercise of that
power.</p>

<p>That Statute has never been repealed. The Americans
of that generation, throughout all the momentous
political battles of the next thirteen years, when they
were making and unmaking nations and creating a federation
of nations, and later subordinating it to a
union of human beings, never failed to obey that Statute
and to act in strict conformity to its basic American
principle.</p>

<p>From the moment when that Statute was enacted by
the supreme will in America, every American ceased
forever to be a “subject” of any government or governments
in the world. It was not until 1917 that
any government or governments dared to act as if the
American were still a “subject.”</p>

<p>In that summer of 1776, as the Americans were
engaged with their former Government in a bitter
and protracted war, they had little time or thought to
give, as one people, to the constitution of a government
best designed to secure to themselves the utmost
possible measure of protected enjoyment of individual
human freedom. In their rebellion, they had delegated
the management of their common interests to a
committee of deputies from each former colony, which
committee was called the Congress. By the declared
supreme will of the whole American people, the Americans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
in each former colony now constituted an independent
nation, whose human members were now the
“citizens” of that nation. Under the declared basic
American legal principle, it was imperative that any
government should get its every valid power from its
own citizens. Knowing this, the Congress, almost
immediately after the Declaration of July, made the
formal suggestion to the citizens in each nation that
they constitute a government for themselves and that
they grant to such government ability to interfere with
their own human freedom in such matters and to such
extent as they deemed wise. The manner in which
the citizens of each nation acted upon this suggestion
should have stamped itself so irrevocably upon the
mind of America as never to have been forgotten by
any later generation of Americans. The citizens of
those nations were of the “people who were better
acquainted with the science of government than any
other people in the world.” In each nation they were
creating the very essence of security for a free people,
namely, a government with limited ability to interfere
with individual freedom, in some matters, so as to
secure the greatest possible protected enjoyment of
human liberty. They knew, as only human beings <i>could</i>
know who were then offering their very lives to uphold
the basic law of America, that such ability could never
be validly given to any government by government
itself, acting in any manner, but only by direct action
and grant of those later to be governed by the exercise
of that ability. What method did those citizens,
so thoroughly educated in the basic principles of republican
government, employ to secure the direct action
of the human beings themselves in giving that ability
<i>of that kind</i> to their respective governments? They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
acted upon the suggestion from the Congress of 1776,
as Marshall later expressed it from the Bench of the
Supreme Court, “in the only manner in which they
can act safely, <i>effectively</i> and wisely <i>on such a subject</i>,
by assembling in convention” in their respective states.
Long before Marshall voiced judicial approval of
this <i>American</i> method of direct action by the people
themselves, in matters in which only <i>the people</i> themselves
can validly act at all, Madison, in the famous
Virginia convention of 1788, paid his tribute to these
conventions of the people in each of the thirteen nations.
This was the tribute of Madison: “Mr. Chairman,
nothing has excited more admiration in the world
than the manner in which free governments have been
established in America; for it was the first instance,
from the creation of the world to the American Revolution,
that free inhabitants have been seen deliberating
on a form of government, and selecting such of
their citizens as possessed their confidence, to determine
upon and give effect to it.” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 616.)</p>

<p>Later herein there will be occasion to speak at
greater length of this American method of direct action
by the people themselves, through the deliberative
conventions of deputies chosen by the people and from
the people for that one purpose, giving to governments
a limited ability to interfere with individual freedom.
At this point, it is sufficient to say that, since 1789 and
until 1917, no government in America ever claimed
to have acquired ability <i>of that kind</i> except through
the action of such a convention or conventions or
through the direct voting of its citizens themselves for
or against the grant of such ability.</p>

<p>If we again turn our minds upon those later days
of 1776, we find that the Americans, through the direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
action of the people in each independent nation, had
become respectively citizens of what we now know as
their respective states, each of which was then a free
nation. Those thirteen nations were then allied in
war. There did not yet exist even that political entity,
later created and known as a federation of those nations.
At that time and until quite some years after
the Revolution had ended, there was no such thing as
a “citizen” of America, because the America we know,
the organized human membership society which is the
American nation, did not yet exist. At that time and
until the American nation did actually exist, as a political
entity, there was no government in the world and
no collection of governments in the world, which, on
any subject or to any extent, could interfere <i>generally</i>
with the individual freedom of Americans, <i>as</i> Americans.
In each of the thirteen American nations, the
citizens of that nation had vested their own government
with some ability <i>of that kind</i>.</p>

<p>At this point, it is well to digress for a moment in
order that we may well understand that in none of
these thirteen nations did its citizens vest in its government
an <i>unlimited</i> ability to interfere with individual
freedom. All the citizens of those respective nations
were then battling with a mighty Government which
claimed such unlimited ability over all of them, as subjects,
and they were battling to establish forever in
America the basic doctrine that no government of free
men could ever have unlimited ability of that kind. In
each of the thirteen nations, its citizens vested its government
with ability <i>of that kind only</i> to a limited
extent. They did this in strict conformity to republican
principles.</p>

<p>For the many who do not know, it is well to state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
clearly the distinction between a pure democracy and
a republic. In both, the human beings constitute the
nation or the state and are its citizens. In both, the
citizens <i>themselves</i> limit the matters and the extent
in which they shall be governed at all in restraint of
their individual freedom. In both, therefore, it is
accurate and truthful to state that the people govern
themselves. The actual difference lies in one fact. In
a democracy the people <i>themselves</i> assemble and themselves
enact each specific rule of conduct or law interfering
with individual freedom. In a republic, it is
always possible that the citizens <i>may</i> assemble, as in
a pure democracy, and enact any specific rule of conduct
or law. But, in a republic, its citizens generally
prefer to act, in such matters, through attorneys in
fact or representatives, chosen by themselves for the
special purpose of exercising a wise discretion in making
<i>such</i> laws. In a true republic, however, where the
citizens are to remain free men, they secure to themselves
absolute control of their representative lawmakers
through two most effective means. <i>In the first
place</i>, they ordain that their attorneys in fact for the
purpose of law-making, generally called their legislators,
shall be selected by themselves from time to
time, at comparatively short intervals. This precaution
enables the people, through new attorneys in fact,
quickly to repeal a law of which they do not approve.
<i>In the second place</i>, the people, in constituting their
government, limit the law-making ability of these temporary
attorneys in fact or legislators. This is the
most important fact in a free republic. Later herein
there will be explained the marvelous and effective
manner in which this particular security for human
freedom was later achieved by the citizens of the Republic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
which we know as America, when <i>they</i> constituted
<i>their</i> government. At present, there is to be
mentioned the general method which the citizens of
each of those thirteen nations, in 1776, employed to
achieve this particular security.</p>

<p>In each nation the citizens constituted a legislature
to be their only attorney in fact for the purpose of
making valid laws. In this legislative department they
did not vest enumerated powers to interfere with individual
freedom. But in it they did vest whatever
ability <i>of that kind</i>, under the American doctrine of
human liberty, they thought a government of free men
or citizens ought to have. They did not, however,
grant unlimited ability to make laws interfering with
individual freedom. When constituting their government
they named many matters in which no laws could
be made, such as laws abridging the right of free
speech, laws suspending the privilege of habeas corpus,
etc. Outside these named matters, they granted
law-making ability <i>of that kind</i> to whatever extent
American principles of human liberty determined a
government ought to have. The extent of that ability,
so to be determined, they left to the legislature to
ascertain in the first instance. But to the judicial
department they gave the right finally to ascertain and
decide whether, in any particular law, the legislative
department had exceeded its granted ability.</p>

<p>In living again the education days of the Americans,
who later created and constituted the republican
nation which is America, we have come now to the
close of the eventful year 1776. We find ourselves,
at that time, viewing this status of the American human
being and his relation to all governments.</p>

<p>With his fellow Americans, he has declared that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
they are not the subjects of any government or governments
in the world. With his fellow Americans, on
many battlefields, he is fighting their former Government,
which still claims that they are its subjects. If
he is a Virginian, he and his fellow Virginians, with
the consent of their fellow Americans, have constituted
themselves a free and independent nation of human
beings and have given to <i>their</i> law-making attorney in
fact, the legislature of Virginia, some ability to make
laws in restraint of the individual freedom of Virginians,
in such matter and to such extent, as the citizens
of Virginia have deemed wise. In each of the other
twelve nations the situation is the same. In no nation,
in America, has any government servant and attorney
in fact of the people any ability whatever to interfere
with human freedom in any matter or to any extent,
except such ability of that kind as has been given to
that government by direct grant from its citizens. Nowhere,
in America, has <i>any</i> government <i>any</i> power
whatever, in <i>any</i> matter or to <i>any</i> extent, to make a
valid command restraining the human freedom of the
individual <i>American</i> as an American. All Americans
are fighting throughout America with the armies of the
only government in the world which claims such ability.
All Americans everywhere are determined to
win that war and keep it the basic law of America that
no government ever <i>shall</i> have ability <i>of that kind</i>
unless the whole American people, by direct grant
from themselves, shall give it to a general American
government. There is yet no republic of America.
There are yet no citizens of America. There are only
citizens of thirteen respective nations, which nations
are allied in an existing war. The affairs of the allied
nations are being directed by a committee of delegates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
from the different nations, called the Congress. The
first Committee or Congress of that kind, known in
history as the First Continental Congress, had met at
Philadelphia from September 5 to October 26, 1774,
and “recommended peaceful concerted action against
British taxation and coercion.” The second Committee,
known as the Second Continental Congress, had
assembled, also at Philadelphia, on May 10, 1775,
and had assumed direction of the war.</p>

</div>


<p>We have now lived with the American of an earlier
generation through the days in which he ceased to
be a subject of any government, and in which he established
forever in America the basic law that no government
can exercise or possess any ability to interfere
with his individual freedom except by direct grant
from its citizens. We have seen him, in each of the
former colonies, create a nation, become one of its
citizens and, with his fellow citizens of that nation,
give to its government <i>some</i> ability <i>of that kind</i>.</p>

<p>When we recall it to be the tribute of history that
<i>these</i> Americans were better acquainted with the science
of government than any other people in the
world, it is well to reflect for a moment upon the significant
exhibition of that knowledge during the days
through which we have just lived with them.</p>

<p>When the suggestion came from Philadelphia, in
the summer of 1776, that the Americans in each former
colony constitute a government for their own
nation and give to it a limited ability to govern themselves
in restraint of their individual freedom, it is
recorded history that Americans generally knew that
a gift <i>of that kind</i> to government could never be validly
made by governments. It “was felt and acknowledged
by all” that only its own citizens ever could grant ability
<i>of that kind</i> to any government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>As the people of New England had been the most
thoroughly trained in the actual experience of self
government, we naturally find them acting upon and
clearly stating the American legal principle that legislatures
never can give ability <i>of that kind</i> to government.
The records of Concord, Massachusetts, for
October 21, 1776, show how clearly this was understood
by the Americans of that generation. After the
Philadelphia suggestion had been made, the Massachusetts
legislature framed a constitution and sent it
to the Massachusetts townships for approval. On that
October 21, 1776, the people of Concord refused to
act upon it. Their reason was that government ability
to interfere with human freedom could never come
from legislatures but must always come <i>directly</i> from
the citizens themselves. Let the Americans of
Concord, in their own words, impart some of their
knowledge to the Americans of this generation.</p>

<p>“Resolved secondly, that the supreme Legislative,
either in their proper capacity or in joint committee,
are by no means a body proper to form and establish
a Constitution or form of government for reasons following,
viz.: First, because we conceive that Constitution
in its proper idea intends a system of principles
established to secure the subject in the possession of
and enjoyment of their Rights and Privileges against
any encroachment of the Governing Part. Secondly,
because the same body that forms a Constitution have
of consequence a power to alter it. Thirdly, because
a Constitution alterable by the Supreme Legislative is
no security at all to the subject against the encroachment
of the Governing Part on any or on all their
Rights and Privileges.”</p>

<p>(See <i>Constitutional Review</i>, April, 1918, p. 97.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>The people of Concord or New England were not
alone in this knowledge. On this we have the later
testimony of Marshall from the Bench of the Supreme
Court. Speaking of that day, a few years after 1776,
when the whole American people created <i>their</i> nation
and gave enumerated powers <i>of that kind</i> to <i>its</i> government,
he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But when, “in order to form a more perfect Union,”
it was deemed necessary to change this alliance into an effective
government, possessing great and sovereign powers,
and acting directly on the people, the necessity of referring
it to the people, and of deriving its powers <i>directly</i> from
them, was felt and acknowledged by all. (M’Culloch v.
Maryland, 4 <i>Wheat.</i> 316.)</p>
</div>

<p>Fixing this knowledge of that day firmly in our
mind, let us go on with the remarkable Americans of
that generation through the next period in which the
relation of government to government and of nation
to nation was changed, but in which the status of the
citizen of each nation and his relation to all governments
remained exactly what he and his fellow citizens
of that nation had made it.</p>

<p>On November 15, 1777, there came from the Congress
at Philadelphia another suggestion, this time a
proposal to the thirteen nations that they, already allied
in an existing war, should form a permanent union
or federation of nations. With that proposal went a
drafted set of constitutional Articles, having for their
purpose the establishment of a government (to be
called a Congress) for the proposed federation, some
of which Articles would give to that government ability
to govern the members of the union, the thirteen
nations. The proposal and the constitutional Articles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
were sent, for ratification or rejection, to the legislature
of each nation as its proper attorney in fact in
creating a <i>federal</i> union of nations and in giving
<i>federal</i> ability to govern, which <i>federal</i> ability never
directly interferes with individual freedom.</p>

<p>Let us reflect upon the accurate knowledge of the
science of government again shown by the Americans
of that generation in that proposal. Only a few short
months earlier there had come, from the same men at
Philadelphia, the proposal that <i>national</i> government
be established in each nation. These men at Philadelphia
had been subjects of the British Government until
July, 1776. All government ability to interfere with
human freedom, then as now, under British law, had
its source in a legislature, the Westminster Parliament.
And yet these men at Philadelphia, in the summer
of 1776, had accurately known that, under basic
American law, <i>such</i> government ability could only have
one valid source, direct action by the citizens themselves
assembled in conventions. Acting on this knowledge
in the summer of 1776, the suggestion that government
in each state be given <i>national</i> power to govern,
namely, ability directly to interfere with individual
freedom, had come as a suggestion to the citizens of
each nation for their own direct action. That suggestion
had been followed, and thus had been exercised,
for the first time since Americans ceased to be subjects,
the inherent and inalienable and always existing ability
of the citizens of a free nation to make any kind of
constitutional Articles of government, including the
<i>national</i> kind which give government any power to
interfere with individual freedom.</p>

<p>When, therefore, these same men at Philadelphia
made their proposal of November, 1777, that other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
constitutional Articles of government be made in America,
the proposed Articles of Union between nations,
it might have been natural that this proposal also
should have suggested ratification of <i>these</i> Articles by
the people themselves. It would have seemed all the
more natural, when we remember that one of the
leaders at Philadelphia in that time was Jefferson, the
historic champion of human individual freedom against
all governments. But the Americans of that generation
and their leaders were not as the leaders of our
own time. They knew very accurately the difference
between a <i>national</i> Article of government, which gave
ability to interfere with human freedom, and a <i>federal</i>
Article, which gave no ability <i>of that kind</i> but only
ability to govern nations or states, as political entities.
With this accurate knowledge of the vital distinction
between a <i>national</i> and a <i>federal</i> Article, they naturally
knew that either the people themselves or the legislative
attorney in fact of the nation, which makes all
agreements for the nation with other nations, may
validly make a <i>federal</i> Article. Therefore, they sent
the proposed Articles of Confederation between nations
(not one of which gave <i>national</i> power to the
proposed <i>federal</i> government) to the legislatures of
the respective nations for ratification or rejection on
behalf of the nations. As Marshall later summed up
the knowledge which prompted that sending of those
<i>federal</i> articles to the legislatures:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the formation of a league, such as was the Confederation,
the State sovereignties were certainly competent.
(M’Culloch v. Maryland, 4 <i>Wheat.</i> 316.)</p>
</div>

<p>Each state legislature acted favorably upon the proposed
articles and ratified them. By July 9, 1778, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
legislatures of ten states had ratified. The legislatures
of New Jersey and Delaware followed before the end
of February, 1779. The legislature of Maryland did
not ratify until March 1, 1781.</p>

<p>It is well for the average American of the present
generation, at this point, to fix firmly in his mind that
this <i>legislative</i> ratification of these <i>federal</i> Articles was
the important exercise of an existing and recognized
ability of state legislatures to make all constitutional
articles of a <i>federal</i> nature, which never confer any
government ability directly to interfere with human
freedom. It is well for the same American also to
fix firmly in his mind that it was the exercise of an
ability to make constitutional articles entirely distinct
from the other existing ability to make them, which had
been exercised, in each nation, directly by the citizens
themselves, in “conventions,” in the preceding year of
1776. In that year, there had been exercised the inherent
and inalienable and always existing ability of
citizens of a nation, assembled in conventions of deputies
chosen for that express purpose, to make <i>any</i> kind
of constitutional article, whether it confers <i>federal</i> or
<i>national</i> power on government. In the years 1777 to
1781, there had been exercised the recognized and
existing <i>but limited</i> ability of state legislatures to make
<i>federal</i> articles, an ability clearly then known not to
include the ability to confer upon government <i>national</i>
power to interfere with individual freedom.</p>

<p>Living with those Americans through their great
days, we have now reached the day in 1781 when they
were all citizens of <i>some</i> nation but were not all citizens
of the same nation. The great Republic, America,
had not yet been born. The legal status of the American
as an individual, and his relation to all governments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
was exactly the same as it had been since 1776. Each
American was the citizen of some nation. His individual
freedom could be directly interfered with only
by some law of the legislature of that single nation
under a valid grant, from him and his fellow citizens,
of power to enact that law on that subject. Neither
the legislature of any other nation in America, nor the
legislatures of all other nations in America, nor the
government of nations which those legislatures had
created and endowed with <i>federal</i> powers, the Congress
of the Federation, could singly or collectively
issue a single command to him, interfering in any
manner with his human freedom, or could give to any
government or governments a power to issue such a
command.</p>

<p>There were existing and recognized by all in
America two distinct and different abilities—one limited
and the other unlimited—to make constitutional
articles. One was the limited ability of state legislatures.
They could give <i>federal</i> power to a government,
but they could not give any <i>national</i> power or
power directly to interfere with human freedom. The
other was the unlimited ability of the citizens of any
nation. They could give <i>any</i> kind of power, federal
or national, to their own government. Each ability, at
a different time, had been evoked to exercise by a distinct
proposal from the same Americans at Philadelphia,
the Second Continental Congress, which had
under its direction the conduct of the Revolutionary
War.</p>

<p>Dormant for the time being, but existing over all
other ability in America, was the supreme will of the
collective people of America, who had not yet created
their own great Republic or become its citizens or given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
to its government its enumerated powers to interfere
with their individual freedom.</p>

<p>This was the legal status of the American, and his
relation to all governments, and the relation of governments
in America to one another, when the Treaty
of Peace was concluded with England on September 3,
1783, and was later ratified by the Federal Congress
on January 14, 1784.</p>

</div>


<p>Living over the great days of our forefathers, we
now approach the greatest of all. It comes four
years after the end of the Revolution. Not satisfied
with a mere union of their states, the whole American
people, in 1787, proposed to form the great nation of
men, America. On June 21, 1788, it is created by
them. On March 4, 1789, its only government, now
also the government of the continued union of states,
begins to function.</p>

<p>Between May 29, 1787, and March 4, 1789, the
whole American people did their greatest work for
individual liberty. That was their greatest day.
Most Americans of this generation know nothing
about that period. Still more is it to be regretted that
our leaders in public life, even our most renowned
lawyers, do not understand what was achieved therein
for human freedom. It is of vital importance to the
average American that <i>he</i> always know and understand
and realize that achievement. That he do so, it is not
in the slightest degree essential that he be learned in
the law. It is only necessary that he know and understand
a few simple facts. The experience of five years
since 1917 teaches one lesson. It is that Americans,
who have not the conviction that they are great constitutional
thinkers, far more quickly than those who
have that conviction, can grasp the full meaning of the
greatest event in American history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>The reason is plain. Back in the ages, there was a
time when scientific men “<i>knew</i>” that the earth was
flat. Because <i>they</i> “knew” it, the rest of men assumed
that it was so. And, because <i>they</i> “knew” it, it was
most difficult to convince <i>them</i> that their “knowledge”
was <i>false</i> “knowledge.”</p>

<p>In a similar way, our statesmen and constitutional
thinkers came to the year 1917 with the “knowledge”
that legislatures in America, if enough of them combined,
had exactly the omnipotence over the individual
freedom of the American which had been denied to
the British Parliament by the early Americans.
Naturally, it is difficult for <i>them</i> to understand that
their “knowledge” is <i>false</i> “knowledge.” For us who
have no false knowledge to overcome, it is comparatively
simple to grasp what those other plain Americans
of 1787 and 1788 meant to accomplish and did
accomplish. Why should it not be simple for us?
With those other plain Americans, we have just been
through their strenuous years which immediately preceded
their greatest days of 1787 and 1788. They
were a simple people as are we average Americans of
this generation. From living with them through those
earlier days, we have come to know their dominant
purpose. They sought to secure to themselves and to
their posterity the greatest measure of protected enjoyment
of human life, liberty and happiness against
interference from outside America and against usurpation
of power by any governments in America. Certainly,
it ought not to be difficult for us to grasp
accurately and quickly what they meant to do and what
they did do in their last and greatest achievement in
the quest of that protected enjoyment of human freedom.
But, with all our happy predisposition accurately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
to understand the meaning of the facts in 1787
and 1788, that understanding cannot come until we
know the facts themselves. Let us, therefore, live
through those years with those other plain Americans
of whom we <i>are</i> the posterity. Only then can we understand
their legacy of secured liberty to us <i>and keep
it against usurpation by those who do not understand</i>.</p>

<p>So long as the former subjects continued their Revolution,
it was only natural that Americans should not
realize how inadequately a mere federation of states
would serve really to secure the protected enjoyment
of individual human freedom. But, as soon as that
war had ended, discerning men began quickly to realize
that fact. Jealousies between nations, jealousies in
abeyance while those nations were fighting a common
war for independence, quickly had their marked effect
upon the relations of these nations to one another and
upon the respect which they showed to the commands
of the government of the federation of which all those
nations were members. As a matter of fact, those
commands, because the governing powers of that government
were wholly <i>federal</i>, were tantamount to
nothing but requisitions. Those requisitions were honored
largely by ignoring them. There was no way
of enforcing respect for them or compelling observance
of them. The plan of a purely <i>federal</i> union of
nations permitted no method of enforcement save that
of war upon whatever nation or nations might refuse
obedience to a requisition. Such a war would have
been repugnant to the mind of every patriotic
American.</p>

<p>This was only one of the many defects coming from
the fact that Americans, in spirit one people or nation,
had no political existence as one nation and had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
general <i>national</i> government, with general powers
over all Americans, to command respect at home and
abroad for the individual freedom of the American.</p>

<p>There is neither time nor necessity for dwelling
further upon the fact, quickly brought home to the
American people after the close of their Revolution,
that a purely <i>federal</i> government of the states was no
adequate security for their own freedom. Let the
words of one of themselves, apologizing for the inadequacy
of that government, attest their quick recognition
that it was inadequate. They are the words of
Jay in <i>The Federalist</i> of 1787. This is what he said:
“A strong sense of the value and blessings of union
induced the people, at a very early period, to institute
a federal government to preserve and perpetuate it.
They formed it almost as soon as they had a political
existence; nay, at a time when their habitations were
in flames, when many of their citizens were bleeding,
and when the progress of hostility and desolation left
little room for those calm and mature inquiries and
reflections which must ever precede the formation of
a wise and well-balanced government for a free people.
It is not to be wondered at, that a government instituted
in times so inauspicious, should on experiment be
found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpose
it was intended to answer.” (<i>Fed.</i>, No. 2.)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br><span class="small">THE BIRTH OF THE NATION</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Living through those old days, immediately after
the peace with England of 1783, we find that public
and official recognition of a fatal defect in the <i>federal</i>
form of union came from the inability of its
<i>federal</i> government, which had no power over commerce,
to establish a uniform regulation of trade
among the thirteen American nations themselves and
between them and foreign nations. Discerning men,
such as Madison and Washington and others, already
recognized other incurable defects in any form of
union which was solely a union of nations and not a
union of the American people themselves, in one nation,
with a government which should have <i>national</i>, as
well as <i>federal</i>, powers. Taking advantage of the
general recognition that some central power over commerce
was needed, the legislature of the nation of
Virginia appointed James Madison, Edmund Randolph
and others, as commissioners to meet similar
commissioners to be appointed by the twelve other
nations. The instructions to these commissioners
were to examine into the trade situation and report
to their respective nations as to how far a uniform
system of commerce regulations was necessary. The
meeting of these commissioners was at Annapolis in
September, 1786. Only commissioners from the nations
of Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
and New York attended. The other eight nations
were not represented.</p>

<p>Madison and Hamilton were both present at Annapolis
and figured largely in what was done there.
It is an interesting and important fact that these two
played a large part from its very inception in the peaceful
Revolution which brought to an end the independent
existence of thirteen nations—a Revolution
which subordinated these nations, their respective
national governments, and their federation to a new
nation of the whole American People, and to the Constitution
and the government of that new nation.</p>

<p>At every stage of <i>that</i> Revolution, these two men
were among its foremost leaders. Recorded history
has made it plain that Madison, more than any other
man in America, participated in planning what was
accomplished in that Revolution. He drafted the substance
of most of the Articles in what later became the
Constitution of the new nation. By the famous essays
(nearly all of which were written by himself or Hamilton)
in <i>The Federalist</i>, explaining and showing the
necessity of each of those Articles, he contributed most
effectively to their making by the people of America,
assembled in their conventions. He actually drew,
probably in conference with Hamilton, what we know
as the Fifth Article, which will later herein be largely
the subject of our exclusive interest.</p>

<p>The Annapolis commissioners made a written report
of their recommendations. This report was sent to
the respective legislatures of the five nations, which
had commissioners at Annapolis. Copies were also
sent to the Federal Congress and to the Executives of
the other eight nations in the federation. The report
explained that the commissioners had become convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
that there were many important defects in the
federal system, in addition to its lack of any power
over commerce. The report recommended that the
thirteen nations appoint “commissioners, to meet at
Philadelphia on the second Monday in May next, to
take into consideration the situation of the United
States; to devise such further provisions as shall seem
to them necessary to render the constitution of the
federal government adequate to the exigencies of the
Union; and to report such an act for that purpose, to
the United States in Congress assembled as, when
agreed to by them, and afterwards confirmed by the
legislature of every state, will effectually provide for
the same.”</p>

<p>The Annapolis recommendation was acted upon by
the legislatures of twelve nations. Each nation, except
Rhode Island, appointed delegates to attend the Philadelphia
Convention to begin in May, 1787. Madison
himself, in his introduction to his report of the debates
of the Philadelphia Convention, gives his own explanation
of why Rhode Island did not send delegates.
“Rhode Island was the only exception to a compliance
with the recommendation from Annapolis, well known
to have been swayed by an obdurate adherence to an
advantage, which her position gave her, of taxing her
neighbors through their consumption of imported supplies—an
advantage which it was foreseen would be
taken from her by a revisal of the Articles of Confederation.”
This is mentioned herein merely to bring
home to the minds of Americans of the present generation
the reality of the fact, now so difficult to
realize, that there were <i>then</i> actually in America thirteen
independent nations, each having its powerful
jealousies of the other nations and particularly of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
own immediate neighbors. The actual reality of this
fact is something which the reader should not forget.
It is important to a correct understanding of much that
is said later herein. It is often mentioned in the arguments
that accompanied the making of our Constitution,
that the nation of New Jersey was suffering from
exactly the same trouble as the nation of Rhode Island
was causing to its neighbors. Almost all imported
supplies consumed by the citizens of New Jersey came
through the ports of New York and Philadelphia
and were taxed by the nations of New York and
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Interesting though it would be, it is impossible
herein to give in detail the remarkable story of the
four months’ Convention at Philadelphia in 1787. It
began on May 14 and its last day was September 17.
It is recommended to every American, who desires
any real knowledge of what his nation really is, that he
read, in preference to any other story of that Convention,
the actual report of its debates by Madison,
which he himself states were “written out from my
notes, aided by the freshness of my recollections.” It
is possible only to refer briefly but accurately to those
actual facts, in the history of those four months, which
are pertinent to the object of this book.</p>

<p>At the very outset, it is well for us Americans to
know and to remember the extraordinary nature of the
recommendation which had come from Annapolis and
of the very assembling of that Philadelphia Convention.
The suggestion and the Convention were entirely
outside any written law in America. Every one
of the thirteen colonies was then an independent nation.
These nations were united in a federation. Each
nation had its own constitution. The federation had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
its federal constitution. In none of those constitutions
was there any provision whatever under which any
such convention as that of Philadelphia could be suggested
or held. The federal Constitution provided
the specific mode in which ability to amend any of its
federal Articles could be exercised. Such provision
neither suggested nor contemplated any such convention
as that to be held at Philadelphia. For these
reasons, Madison and Wilson of Pennsylvania and
other leading delegates at that Convention stoutly
insisted that the Philadelphia Convention had not
exercised any power whatever in making a proposal.</p>

<p>“The fact is, they have exercised no power at all;
and, in point of validity, this Constitution, <i>proposed</i>
by them for the government of the United States,
claims no more than a production of the same nature
would claim, flowing from a private pen.” (Wilson,
Pennsylvania State Convention in 1787, 2 <i>Ell. Deb.</i>
470.)</p>

<p>“It is therefore essential that such changes [in government]
be instituted by some <i>informal and unauthorized
propositions</i>, made by some patriotic and
respectable citizen or number of citizens.” (Madison,
<i>Fed.</i> No. 40.)</p>

<p>But there was a development even more remarkable
on the second day of this unauthorized Convention.</p>

<p>The Convention was presided over by Washington.
Among the other delegates were Hamilton of New
York, Madison and Randolph and Mason of Virginia,
Franklin and Wilson and Robert Morris and Gouverneur
Morris of Pennsylvania, and the two Pinckneys
of South Carolina. Madison himself, speaking of
the delegates in his Introduction to his report of
the Debates, says that they were selected in each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
state “from the most experienced and highest
standing citizens.” The reader will not forget that
each of these men came under a commission from
the independent government of a sovereign and
independent nation, twelve such independent governments
and nations being represented in that Convention.
In the face of this important fact, it is
amazing to realize the startling proposition offered
for consideration, on May 30, 1787. On that day, the
Convention having gone into a Committee of the
Whole, Randolph, commissioned delegate from the
independent government and nation of Virginia,
moved, on the suggestion of Gouverneur Morris, commissioned
delegate from another independent government
and nation, that the assembled delegates consider
the three following resolutions:</p>

<p>“1. That a union of the states merely federal will
not accomplish the objects proposed by the Articles of
Confederation—namely, common defense, security of
liberty, and general welfare.</p>

<p>“2. That no treaty or treaties among the whole or
part of the states, as individual sovereignties, would be
sufficient.</p>

<p>“3. That a <i>national</i> government ought to be established,
consisting of a <i>supreme</i> legislative, executive,
and judiciary.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 132.)</p>

<p>If we wish to realize the sensational nature of those
resolutions, let us assume for a moment a similar convention
of delegates assembled in the City of New
York. Let us assume that the delegates have been
commissioned respectively by the governments of
America, Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, France, Belgium and other nations. Let
us assume that the ostensible and proclaimed purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
of the convention, stated in the commissions of the
delegates, is that it frame a set of <i>federal</i> Articles for
a league or federation of the independent nations represented
and report the drafted Articles to the
respective governments for ratification or rejection.
Let us then assume that, on the second day of the convention,
Lloyd George, on the suggestion of Charles E.
Hughes, calmly proposes that the convention, as a
Committee of the Whole, consider three resolutions,
exactly similar to those proposed by Randolph on May
30, 1787. Imagine the amazement of the world when
it found that the resolutions were to the effect that the
convention should draft and propose a constitution
of government which would create an entirely new
nation out of the human beings in all the assembled
nations, and create a new national government for the
new nation, and destroy forever the independence and
sovereignty of each represented nation and its government
and subordinate them to the new national and
supreme government.</p>

<p>This was exactly the nature of the startling resolutions
of Randolph. Moreover, before that one day
closed, the Committee of the Whole actually did resolve
“that a national government ought to be established
consisting of a supreme legislative, executive
and judiciary.” The vote was six to one. Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia
and South Carolina voted “aye.” From that
day on, the Convention continued to prepare a proposal
involving the destruction of the complete independence
of the existing nations and of the governments
which respectively commissioned the delegates
to the Convention. From that day on, the Convention
concerned itself entirely with the drafting of constitutional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Articles which would create a new nation,
America, the members thereof to be all the American
people, and would constitute a national government
for them, and give to it <i>national</i> powers over them,
and make it supreme, in its own sphere, over all the
existing nations and governments.</p>

<p>It is interesting and instructive to know that all this
startling purpose, later completely achieved by appeal
to the existing ability of the possessors of the supreme
will in America, the people, assembled in their conventions,
had not been the conception of a moment.</p>

<p>We find Madison, by many credited with the most
logical mind of his remarkable generation, carefully
planning, <i>long before</i> the meeting of the Convention, a
quite detailed conception of the startling proposal of
Randolph. In a letter from Madison to Randolph,
dated April 8, 1787 (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 107), he speaks of
“the business of May next,” and of the fact “that
some leading propositions at least would be expected
from Virginia,” and says, “I will just hint the ideas that
have occurred, leaving explanations for our interview.”
When we remember the remarkable manner, entirely
novel in the history of political science, in which our
Constitution creates a new nation and its supreme
national government and yet keeps alive the former
independent nations and their federation, the next
sentence of that letter is of absorbing interest. It
reads, “I think, with you, that it will be well to retain
as much as possible of the old Confederation, though
I doubt whether it may not be best to work the valuable
articles into the new system, instead of engrafting the
latter on the former.” When we read the detailed
story of the Philadelphia Convention and study its
product, our Constitution, there worded and later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
made by the people, we realize that Madison’s idea,
expressed in the quoted sentence, was accurately carried
out largely through his own efforts.</p>

<p>Turning now to a later paragraph in that same April
letter, we marvel at the foresight, the logical mind and
the effective ability of the writer in later securing
almost the exact execution of his idea by the entire
people of a continent, even though that idea was the
destruction of the independence of their respective nations
and of their existing respective governments.
That paragraph reads: “I hold it for a fundamental
point, that an individual independence of the states is
utterly irreconcilable with the idea of an aggregate
sovereignty. I think, at the same time, that a consolidation
of the states into one simple republic is not
less unattainable than it would be inexpedient. Let it
be tried, then, whether any middle ground can be
taken, which will at once support a due supremacy of
the national authority, and leave in force the local
authorities so far as they can be subordinately useful.”</p>

<p>This remarkable letter then goes on, paragraph by
paragraph, to suggest that, in the new Articles, the
principle of representation be changed, so as not to be
the same for every state; the new government be given
“positive and complete” <i>national</i> power “in all cases
where uniform measures are necessary”; the new government
keep all the federal powers already granted;
the judicial department of the new government be
nationally supreme; the legislative department be
divided into two branches; the new government have
an executive department; there be an Article guaranteeing
each state against internal as well as external
dangers. In other words, the letter reads like a
synopsis of the principal provisions of our present Constitution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
although the letter was written over a month
before the Philadelphia Convention began to draft
that Constitution.</p>

<p>One paragraph in that remarkable letter is very important
as the first of many similar statements, with
the reasons therefor, made by Madison in the Philadelphia
Convention, in the Virginia convention which
ratified the Constitution and in <i>The Federalist</i> which
urged its ratification. Madison was writing his letter
within a few short years after the American people had
made their famous Statute of 1776. He knew its basic
law that every ability in government to interfere with
individual freedom must be derived directly by grant
from those to be governed. He knew that governments
could give to government <i>federal</i> power to prescribe
rules of conduct for nations. He also knew
that governments could not give to government any
power to prescribe rules of personal conduct which
interfered with the exercise of individual human freedom.
In other words, he knew the existing and limited
ability of legislatures to make <i>federal</i> Articles and that
such limited legislative ability was not and never could
be, in America, competent to make <i>national</i> Articles.
He also knew the existing ability of Americans themselves,
assembled in their conventions, to make any
kind of constitutional Article, whether it were federal
or national. He knew that the limited ability had been
exercised in making the <i>federal</i> Articles of the existing
federation and that the unlimited ability had been
exercised, in each existing nation, in making its <i>national</i>
Articles.</p>

<p>With this accurate knowledge always present in his
mind and repeatedly finding expression by him in the
ensuing two years, it is natural that we find in his remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
letter of 1787, after his summary of what
Articles the new Constitution ought to contain and
nearly every one of which it does contain, the following
significant statement: “To give the new system its
proper energy, it will be desirable to have it ratified
by the authority of the people, and not merely by that
of the legislatures.” From such a logical American, it
is expected that we should find accurate echo again and
again of this deference to basic American law in such
later expressions as his statement in <i>The Federalist</i>,
Number 37, “The genius of republican liberty seems
to demand ... that all power should be derived
from the people.”</p>

<p>Having thus grown well aware of the tremendous
part played by Madison in shaping the substance of the
Constitution of government under which we Americans
live, let us return to the Philadelphia Convention in
which he figured so prominently and which worded and
proposed the Articles of that Constitution.</p>

<p>In the seven Articles, which were finally worded by
that Convention, there are but three which concern
themselves at all with the vesting of national power
in government. They are the First, the Fifth and the
Seventh.</p>

<p>The First Article purports to give, in relation to
enumerated matters, <i>all</i> the <i>national</i> power which the
Constitution purports anywhere to grant to its only
donee of power to make laws interfering with human
freedom, the national Legislature or Congress. Indeed,
the opening words of that First Article explicitly
state that, “All legislative Powers herein granted shall
be vested in a Congress of the United States, which
shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.”
Then the remaining sections of that Article<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
go on to enumerate all the powers of that kind, the
<i>national</i> powers, which are granted in the Constitution
by the donors, the American people or citizens, assembled
in their conventions.</p>

<p>If there be any doubt in the mind of any American
that the First Article contains the enumeration of <i>all
national</i> powers granted by the Constitution, the statements
of the Supreme Court, voiced by Marshall,
ought to dispel that doubt.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This instrument contains an enumeration of powers expressly
granted by the people to their government....
In the <i>last</i> of the enumerated powers, that which grants,
expressly, the means for carrying all others into execution,
Congress is authorized “to make all laws which shall be
necessary and proper” for the purpose. (Gibbons v. Ogden,
9 <i>Wheat.</i> 1.)</p>
</div>

<p>This “<i>last</i>” of the enumerated powers, as Marshall
accurately terms it, is that granted in the last paragraph
of Section 8 of the First Article.</p>

<p>It is <i>because</i> the First Article IS the constitution of
government of the American citizen that his government
has received its tribute as a government of
enumerated powers. This fact is clearly explained
in the Supreme Court in Kansas v. Colorado, 206
U. S. 46.</p>

<p>Indeed, we need no Marshall to make us fully understand
that when human beings constitute a government,
the one important thing which they do is to grant
government power to interfere, within a limited discretion,
with their own individual freedom by issuing
commands in restraint of the exercise of that freedom.
Anything else that the government is authorized to do
is a mere incident of its existence as a government.
The power to issue commands interfering with human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
freedom is the substance and essence of government.
That is why all the <i>national</i> powers of any American
government are included in whatever ability its legislature
has to make valid commands <i>of that kind</i>. The
letter which went from the Philadelphia Convention,
with the proposed Constitution, accurately expresses
this fact in the words, “Individuals entering into society
must give up a share of liberty to preserve the
rest.” (1 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 17.) By surrender of some of
their liberties is meant their grant of power to make
commands or laws interfering with those surrendered
liberties. Whenever government is constituted, “the
people must cede to it some of their natural rights, in
order to vest it with requisite powers.” (Jay, <i>Fed.</i>
No. 2.)</p>

<p>We thus know for a certainty that the First Article
of our Constitution is the only one which purports to
vest in government any <i>national</i> powers.</p>

<p>The Second Article deals entirely with the executive
department, the authority of the president and that
department to enforce valid laws, the election of the
president and vice-president, etc. The Third Article
deals with the authority of the judicial department
[including authority to declare what laws have been
validly passed, etc.] and with the manner of the appointment
of the members of that department, etc.
The Fourth Article contains miscellaneous declaratory
statements of certain things which the citizens of
America make the fundamental law of America. The
Sixth Article contains other declaratory statements of
what is also made the fundamental law of America.</p>

<p>This leaves to be considered only the Fifth and the
Seventh Articles. Like the First Article, they <i>relate</i> to
the vesting of <i>national</i> power in our American <i>national</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
government; but, unlike the First Article, neither of
them purports to grant any such power to any government.
They deal with the <i>manner</i> of its grant by the
only competent grantors of power of <i>that kind</i>, the
“conventions” of the American people, called by that
name, “conventions,” in the Fifth and Seventh Articles.
As the Seventh Article was intended by those who
worded it to accomplish its purpose simultaneously
with and by reason of its ratification, and as its purpose
was the main object of the Convention which framed
all the Articles, we will consider it before the Fifth.</p>

<p>The Seventh is merely the explicit declaratory statement
of those whose “expressed authority ... alone
could give due validity to the Constitution,” the
Americans themselves assembled in their conventions,
that when the Americans, assembled in nine of those
thirteen conventions, have answered “Yes” to the entire
proposed Constitution, the American nation shall
instantly exist, all Americans in those former nations
where those nine conventions assembled shall instantly
be the citizens of the new nation, and all the grants of
<i>national</i> power, expressed in the First Article of that
Constitution, shall have been validly made as the first
important act of that collective citizenship.</p>

<p>We now consider for a moment the Fifth Article,
the only remaining one which relates to grant of
<i>national</i> power. That Fifth Article does not relate to
grant of <i>national</i> power alone. It also relates to grant
of <i>federal</i> power. It relates to the <i>future</i> grant of
either of those vitally distinct kinds of power. It is
further proof of the logical mind of the man who
wrote that extraordinary letter of April, 1787, and
who largely, in substance, planned the entire system of
a constitution of government, both federal and national,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
which is embodied in our Constitution. Madison
and his associates, in <i>The Federalist</i> and in the
Philadelphia Convention and in the various ratifying
conventions, repeatedly stated their knowledge that
the proposed Constitution could not possibly be perfect.
With the utmost frankness, they expressed the
sane conviction that it would be contrary to all human
experience, if it were found perfect in the working out
of an entirely new and remarkable dual system of
government of a free people by themselves, For this
reason, the Fifth Article was worded so as to prescribe
a <i>constitutional mode of procedure</i> in which the <i>existing</i>
ability of the <i>American</i> citizens to make <i>any</i> kind
of Article, whether <i>national</i> or <i>federal</i>, could thereafter
be invoked to exercise and be exercised. It was
also worded so as to provide a <i>constitutional mode of
procedure</i> in which there could be likewise invoked to
exercise and be exercised the existing limited ability of
the state legislatures to make articles which were not
<i>national</i>. As a matter of fact, it was only at the last
moment, in the Convention, that Madison and Hamilton,
remembering this <i>limited</i> ability of those legislatures,
wrote into Article V any mention of it and its
future constitutional exercise. As the story of the
First, Fifth and Seventh Articles, at Philadelphia in
1787, will be more fully treated hereinafter, we leave
them now to continue the brief story of the voluntary
and direct action of the Americans themselves, by
which they created the nation that is America, became
<i>its</i> citizens and, <i>as such</i>, vested its only government
with its enumerated <i>national</i> powers.</p>

<p>When the Philadelphia Convention, on September
17, 1787, had completed its voluntary task of wording
the proposed Constitution of a nation and its supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
government of enumerated powers, the proposed Constitution
was referred to the American people, for their
own approval or rejection, assembled in their conventions.</p>

<p>In many respects, the Philadelphia ascertainment of
the legal necessity that it <i>must</i> be referred to those
people themselves and the Philadelphia decision to
that effect, following that ascertainment, constitute the
most important and authoritative legal reasoning and
decision ever made in America since July 4, 1776.
Both reasoning and decision were naturally based upon
the fact that the First Article purports to give <i>national</i>
powers to Congress to make laws, interfering with the
individual freedom of the citizens of America. In the
face of that decisive fact, it was impossible for the
Americans at Philadelphia, who had worded that
proposed Article with its grant of enumerated powers
<i>of that kind</i>, to have made any other legal decision
than a reference of such an Article to the American
people themselves assembled in their conventions, as
the only competent grantors of any <i>national</i> power.</p>

<p>The Americans at Philadelphia were human beings
of exactly the same type as all of us. They had their
human ambitions and differences of opinion and jealousies.
They were not supermen any more than we
are. They were grappling with tremendous problems
along an uncharted way in the comparatively new
science of self government by a free people, sparsely
settled along the extensive easterly coast of a continent
and, at the time, citizens of thirteen distinct and independent
nations. Their personal ambitions and differences
of opinion and jealousies, for themselves and
their respective nations, made the problem, which they
set themselves to solve, one almost unparalleled in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
history. If they had wholly failed in their effort, as
men with any other training and dominant purpose in
life would certainly have failed, no just historian
would ever have attributed such failure to any lack of
intelligence or ability or patriotism on their part.</p>

<p>It was, however, their fortune <i>and our own</i> that
their training and dominant purpose in life had been
unique in history. Among them were men, who only
eleven years earlier, at that same Philadelphia, in the
name and on behalf of the American people, had enacted
the Statute of 1776. As their presiding officer,
in their effort of 1787, sat the man who had led the
same American people in their successful effort, by the
sacrifices of a Valley Forge and the battlefields of the
Revolution, to make the declarations of that Statute
the basic principle of American law. Prominent in the
Convention was Hamilton, who had left college at
seventeen to become a trusted lieutenant of the leader
in that war which <i>did</i> make that Statute our basic law.
Among the delegates were quite a few others who had
played similar parts in that same war for that same
purpose. Most of the delegates had played some part,
entailing personal sacrifice and effort, in that same war
and for that same purpose. With such an education in
the school whose training men find it impossible to ignore,
the school of actual life, it was mentally impossible
that this body of men could either forget or ignore
or disobey the basic American law, which then commanded
them and still commands us, that no government
in America can ever have or exercise any valid
national power to interfere with human freedom except
by direct grant from its citizens themselves. If
the education of the leaders of the present generation
had been the same, American history of the last five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
years could have been differently written in a later
chapter herein.</p>

<p>Because the Convention was educated to know the
Statute of ’76, the proposed grant of enumerated
<i>national</i> powers in the First Article was necessarily
referred to the only competent grantors, the American
people themselves, assembled in their conventions.</p>

<p>Familiar as we are with the result of their effort to
solve their great problem, a result told in the history
of the ensuing one hundred and thirty-five years in
America, it seems fitting here to have Madison describe
the closing moment of that Philadelphia Convention,
in his own words: “Whilst the last members
were signing, Dr. Franklin, looking toward the president’s
chair, at the back of which a rising sun happened
to be painted, observed to a few members near him,
that painters had found it difficult to distinguish, in
their art, a rising from a setting sun. ‘I have,’ said he,
‘often and often, in the course of the session, and the
vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked
at that behind the president, without being able to tell
whether it was rising or setting; but now, at length, I
have the happiness to know that it is a rising, and not
a setting sun.’” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 565.)</p>

<p>The story of the actual making of that Constitution
by the people of America, assembled in their conventions,
is a marvelous story. No American can fully
grasp what an American really is unless he personally
reads that story, not as told even by the most gifted
writer, but as told by the recorded debates in the very
conventions themselves of the very Americans who
created the nation which is America, made themselves
its citizens and, as <i>its</i> citizens, made the only <i>valid</i>
grants of enumerated <i>national</i> power, the grants in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
First Article. In a later chapter, somewhat of that
story will be told, mostly in the very words of those
who made those grants. At this point, we are concerned
only to set out the hour and the moment when
American human beings, as such, in their <i>greatest</i>
Revolution, exercised their <i>exclusive</i> ability to give
their one government some <i>national</i> power to interfere
with individual freedom.</p>

<p>Each of them was already a citizen of one of the
existing nations. It was, however, as American human
beings, always collectively the possessors of the supreme
will in America, and not as citizens of any
nation, that they assembled in the conventions and, in
the exercise of that supreme will, created a new and
one American nation, by becoming its charter members
and citizens. That was the first and immediate effect
of the signing of that Constitution in the ninth convention
of the American people, the convention in New
Hampshire, on June 21, 1788. That is the actual day
of the birth of the American nation as a political entity.
It is the day on which the American citizen, member
of the American nation, first existed. While it is true
that there yet was no actual government of the new
nation, it cannot be denied that legally, from that June
21, 1788, there did exist an American nation, as a
political society of human beings, and that its members
were the human beings in the former nations of Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, and
New Hampshire. The very moment the Americans in
those nine former nations had signed that Constitution
of government, they had constituted themselves a nation
and had become its citizens.</p>

<p>Simultaneously therewith, as <i>its</i> citizens, they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
made their grant of enumerated national powers to
interfere with their own human freedom. Simultaneously
therewith, they had destroyed forever the absolute
independence of their nine nations; they had kept
alive those nations, as partially independent political
societies, each to serve certain purposes of its members
who still remained citizens of that political society as
well as citizens of the new nation; they had taken from
the government of each of those nations much of its
<i>national</i> power, had given to each such government no
new power whatever, but had left with it much of its
former <i>national</i> power over its own citizens; they had
kept alive the federation of nations, now a federation
of partially independent states; they had made their
own new <i>national</i> government also the <i>federal</i> government
of that continuing federation and their own
<i>national</i> Constitution also the <i>federal</i> Constitution of
that continued federation; they had subordinated all
those nine states and the government of each and of
the federation to their own supreme will, as the citizens
of the new nation, expressed in its Constitution.
This was the meaning of the second section of the Sixth
Article in the document, which they had signed, which
reads: “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United
States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and
all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the
Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall
be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or
Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”</p>

<p>The makers of the new nation are identified by the
opening words of the document: “We the People of
the United States, in Order to form a more perfect
Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquillity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
provide for the common defence, promote the general
Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves
and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this
Constitution for the United States of America.”</p>

<p>It would be diverting, were it not somewhat pathetic,
to hear that the Constitution was made by the states.
From that quoted Preamble alone, volumes might be
written to show the absurdity of such thought. It
identifies the makers as “people” and not as political
entities. It expressly says that its makers, “the
people,” ordain it “in order to form a more perfect
Union.” The states already had a perfect union of
states. But the human beings or “people” of all
America had no union of themselves. The only
“people” in America, who had no union of themselves,
identify themselves unmistakably when they say, “We
the <i>people</i> of the United States, in Order to form a
more perfect Union, etc.” They are the “people” or
human beings of America, the whole people of
America, the collective possessors of the supreme will
which had enacted the Statute of ’76.</p>

<p>If this fact had been kept clearly in mind by our
modern leaders and lawyers, the history of the supposed
Eighteenth Amendment would never have been
written. When the whole American people assembled
in their conventions in their respective geographic
states, they did not assemble therein as the citizens of
their respective states. It is true that the Americans,
who assembled in any particular convention, happened
to be citizens of a particular state. But they were also
part of the whole American people, <i>whose act as a
whole people</i> had freed all the colonies and had permitted
the Americans in each colony to constitute a
nation for themselves. And, when the Americans in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
each convention assembled, it was to decide whether
that part of the American people, which resided in
that state, would agree with the American people residing
in other states to become members and citizens
of an entirely different society of men and grant to the
government of the new society power to interfere with
the individual rights of the members of the new society.</p>

<p>How could the “citizens” of an independent nation,
in their capacity as such citizens, become “citizens” of
an entirely different nation, with an entirely different
human membership or citizenry? If the individual
members of a large athletic club in the City of New
York should assemble in its club house to determine
whether they, as individual human beings, should join
with the human members of a number of other athletic
clubs and create a large golf club, with a large human
membership, and become members of that large golf
club, would any of them entertain the absurd thought
that he was becoming a member of the golf club in his
capacity as a member of his existing and smaller athletic
club? This is exactly what happened when the
American people as a whole assembled in their conventions
and decided to become members or citizens
of the new and larger political society of men, while
still remaining members and citizens of their respective
smaller societies of men.</p>

<p>The vital distinction between the citizen of America
and the citizen of a state, although oftentimes one is
the same human being, is probably known to many of
the modern leaders and lawyers who have considered
and argued about the supposed Eighteenth Amendment.
But it has been wholly ignored in every argument
for or against the existence of that Amendment.
As a matter of fact, that vital distinction has always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
been so important a part of our American institutions
that it has been the subject-matter of repeated decisions
in the Supreme Court. It is a distinction amazingly
important, in substance, to individual freedom in America.
So true is this that one of the most important
Amendments ever made to the <i>federal</i> part of our Constitution
was primarily intended to require that every
state must extend to the “privileges or immunities of
citizens” of <i>America</i> the same respect and protection
which the American Constitution had previously only
required that each state must extend to the citizens of
the <i>other states</i>.</p>

<p>When the conventions made the original constitution,
Section 2 of Article IV commanded that “The
Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges
and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.”
After the Civil War had closed, it quickly was realized
that this federal command of the Constitution did not
protect the citizens of <i>America</i> in any state. And so
this command was added to the <i>federal</i> part of the
Constitution by the Fourteenth Amendment, namely,
that “No State shall make or enforce any law which
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens”
<i>of America</i>.</p>

<p>It would be idle to repeat here the famous Supreme
Court decisions in which that Court has been obliged
to dwell upon the important result accomplished by this
vital change in the federal part of our Constitution.
In such cases as the Slaughter House Cases, 16 <i>Wall.</i>
36, Paul v. Virginia, 8 <i>Wall.</i> 168, Re Kemmler, 136
<i>U.S.</i> 436, U.S. v. Cruikshank, 92 <i>U.S.</i> 542, Blake v.
McClung, 172 <i>U.S.</i> 239, Maxwell v. Sow, 176 <i>U.S.</i>
581 and numerous other cases the important decisions
have turned entirely upon the vital distinction between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
a citizen of America and a citizen of a particular state,
even though the same man had the two capacities.
Each decision turned upon the fact that the protection
given to him in one capacity, by some constitutional
provision, did not extend to him in the other capacity.</p>

<p>If all this had not been forgotten and ignored during
the five years which began in 1917, the story of that
five years would have been entirely different. Everyone
would have known that the respective attorneys
in fact for societies or states could not grant new
power to interfere with the individual freedom of the
members of an entirely different society, America.</p>

<p>There never was a day at Philadelphia in 1787 when
the clear-minded Americans did not remember and
realize this vital distinction between Americans, in their
capacity as members of their respective existing societies,
and Americans, in their capacity as members of
the prospective society of the whole American people.
There never was a day when they did not realize that
the members of the proposed new and supreme society
of men would never have but one attorney in fact for
any purpose, the government at Washington, while the
members of each small and inferior society would still
have, as they already had, in their capacity as such
members, their own attorney in fact, their own government.</p>

<p>One instance alone is sufficient to show how that
Philadelphia Convention never forgot these important
things. When the Committee of Detail, on August 6,
1787, reported to the Convention the first draft ever
made of our Constitution, the Preamble read: “We,
the people of the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
etc.” (enumerating all the states), “do ordain,
declare, and establish, the following constitution for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
the government of ourselves and our posterity.” (5
<i>Ell. Deb.</i> 376.) But, so that future generations, like
our own, should not ignore the fact that it was not the
people of the respective states but the whole people
of America who made the Constitution, before the
proposal was made from Philadelphia, the Preamble,
identifying the makers of the Constitution, was changed
to read, “We, the people of the United States,”—the
whole people of the new nation, America.</p>

<p>In the Virginia convention, Patrick Henry put the
clear fact all in one pithy statement. He made that
statement in one of his eloquent arguments against
ratification of the Constitution. Many Americans today
do not know that Patrick Henry was the most
zealous opponent of the proposed Constitution. He
was a citizen of the nation of Virginia. His human
liberty as an individual could not be interfered with
by any government or governments in the world except
the Virginia government and only by it, under grant
of <i>national</i> power to it from him and his fellow citizens
of Virginia. That is exactly the status which he wished
to retain for himself and which he insisted was the
best security for individual freedom of all Americans
in Virginia. “This is an American government, not a
Virginia government!” he exclaimed. Nothing could
more clearly express his knowledge, the common
knowledge of all in that day, that he and his fellow
Americans in that convention were being asked as
Americans, not as citizens of Virginia, to constitute
a new nation of the American people and a national
government for that people.</p>

<p>That is why the Tenth Amendment, responsive to
the demand of that Virginia convention and other
similar conventions of the American people, names the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
citizens of the respective states as one class of reservees
and the citizens of America as the great reservee and
“most important factor” in the Tenth Amendment.
This is the plain meaning of the language of that
Tenth Amendment, to those who know what America
is, where that language reads “to the states respectively,
or to the people.” The word “respectively” is
pointedly present after the word “states” and it is
pointedly absent after the word “people.” Nothing
could make more clear, to those who do not forget
that the citizens of each state were the state itself,
that the words “to the states respectively” mean to the
respective peoples or citizens of each state and that
the words “or to the people” mean to the people or
citizens of <i>America</i>, in that capacity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br><span class="small">THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED</span></h2>
</div>


<p>We average Americans have now lived with those
earlier Americans through the years in which they
were educated to their making of the American nation,
to their constitution of its only general government
with <i>national</i> powers.</p>

<p>We have been with them in those early days when
<i>legally</i> they were subjects, inasmuch as their British
Legislature at London had unlimited ability, <i>not delegated
by them</i>, to interfere with the individual human
freedom of each of them and all of them. We have
realized that, in those very early days, despite their
<i>legal</i> status, those Americans were <i>actually</i> and in substance
citizens of their own respective communities,
inasmuch as the legislatures which <i>actually</i> did interfere
with such freedom were the legislatures of their
own choosing to which they themselves delegated such
powers of interference.</p>

<p>We have been with them when their British Government
began its attempt to exercise its omnipotent
ability. We have seen the inevitable result, the American
Revolution, by a people, educated through actual
experience in self government, against the attempt of
any government to exercise a <i>national</i> power not directly
granted by its citizens. We have seen their invincible
determination, in an eight year war of sacrifice,
that no government in America shall ever have
any <i>national</i> power except by direct grant from its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
citizens. We have seen them, in their Statute of ’76—never
repealed—declare this principle to be the basic
law of America.</p>

<p>We have been with them when the Americans in
<i>each</i> former colony constituted for themselves a government
and gave it limited ability to interfere with
their individual freedom. Living with them at that
time, we have realized how accurately they then
grasped the vital fact that the granting of such <i>national</i>
ability <i>is</i> the constitution of government and that no
people ever are free or self-governing unless every
grant <i>of that kind</i> is made directly by the citizens of
the nation themselves.</p>

<p>We have realized that, in constituting their respective
national governments, the citizens of each of
those nations withheld from its government many possible
national powers, such, for example, as those mentioned
in the various Bills of Rights or Declarations
of human liberty in the different written constitutions
of those nations. We have realized—a vital legal
fact never to be forgotten—how accurately those
Americans <i>and their governments</i> knew that not all
of those sovereign legislatures of those independent
nations could, even together, exercise or grant a single
one of those possible national powers reserved by the
people to themselves. We have also realized—again
a legal fact which should have sunk deep into our
souls—that the very national powers, which the citizens
of each of those nations <i>had</i> granted to <i>its</i> legislative
government, were to be exercised only by <i>that</i> legislative
government and could not be delegated by it to
any other government or governments. “The powers
delegated to the state sovereignties were to be exercised
by themselves, not by a distinct and independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
sovereignty created by themselves.” (Marshall,
M’Culloch v. Maryland, 4 <i>Wheat.</i> 316.)</p>

<p>We have lived with those Americans in those Revolutionary
days when the legislative governments of
their thirteen nations created “a distinct and independent
sovereignty” to govern a <i>federal</i> union of
those nations but not to govern, by the exercise of
<i>national</i> powers, the human beings who were the
American people. We have seen those legislative
governments then aware of their existing ability, each
as the representative or attorney in fact of its own
nation for all <i>federal</i> purposes, to vest <i>federal</i> powers
in a <i>federal</i> government. “To the formation of a
league, such as was the Confederation, the state sovereignties
were certainly competent.” (Marshall,
M’Culloch v. Maryland, 4 <i>Wheat.</i> 316.) But those
legislative governments knew that they could not delegate
to any government even those limited <i>national</i>
powers “delegated to the state sovereignties” by their
respective citizens. “The powers delegated to the
state sovereignties were to be exercised by themselves,
not by a distinct and independent sovereignty created
by themselves.” (Marshall, <i>supra</i>.) As to the national
powers not delegated but reserved by the people to
themselves, the legislative governments of that day
(as well as the American people) knew what the Supreme
Court still knew in 1907 as to <i>national</i> powers
similarly withheld from the later <i>national</i> government
of America:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The powers the people have given to the General Government
are named in the Constitution, and all not there
named, either expressly or by implication, are reserved <i>to
the people</i> and can be exercised only by <i>them</i>, or upon <i>further
grant from them</i>. (Justice Brewer in Turner v.
Williams, 194 <i>U. S.</i> 279.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>We have been with those Americans in the few short
years in which they learned that the maximum of protected
enjoyment of individual freedom could never be
obtained through a general government possessing
naught but <i>federal</i> powers, the only kind of power
which any American government can ever obtain
through grants made by governments or, in any way,
except by direct grant from its citizens themselves.</p>

<p>We have been with those Americans through the
greatest Revolution of all, when their leaders and the
average Americans themselves, still determined to obtain
that maximum protected enjoyment of individual
human liberty and awake to the knowledge that it
could not be obtained through a general government
with naught but <i>federal</i> powers, rose again to the
great occasion. We have been with them when, outside
of all then existing constitutions and outside of
all written American law <i>except the Statute of ’76</i>,
those Americans, at the suggestion of their <i>American</i>
leaders, made themselves the members of one great
political society of human beings, the nation which is
America. We have been with them when they gave
the government of America, by direct grant from
themselves, such enumerated <i>national</i> powers to command
them, the citizens of America, as they—<i>not the
state governments</i>—deemed wise and necessary to protect
their human liberty against all oppressors, <i>including
all governments</i>. We have been with them—<i>and
we have marveled</i>—while they themselves actually
made, by their own action, their amazingly effective
distribution of all delegated powers to interfere with
individual freedom.</p>

<p>We have seen that they gave to the new government,
the only government of the citizens of America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
naught but enumerated <i>national</i> powers, with the ability
to make all laws necessary for the proper execution
of those enumerated powers, and reserved to
themselves alone—not to any government or governments
in the world—all other possible national powers
over the self-governing people, the citizens of America.</p>

<p>We have seen how they, the citizens of America,
the possessors of the supreme will in America, then
ended the complete independence of each of the thirteen
nations but reserved to the citizens of each nation
much of their former ability to exercise their own
national powers of government over themselves,
through their own delegation of such power to their
only attorney in fact for such purpose, their own legislature.</p>

<p>We have seen those American citizens, while destroying
the complete independence of those former
nations, incorporate the former federation of states
into their own system of a society or nation of all the
human beings of America. We have seen them, in
the constitution of their own <i>national</i> government,
make it also the <i>federal</i> government of that federation
and leave with it such <i>federal</i> powers as they themselves
deemed wise. We know, therefore, as they
knew in 1790 when their great distribution of power
had become effective, that no legislature in America
could exercise a <i>national</i> power not granted by its own
citizens, and that no legislature or legislatures in America
could give any <i>national</i> power to any government.</p>

<p>We average American citizens of this present generation
must now feel qualified to understand the Constitution
and its settled distribution of all <i>national</i>
powers to interfere with individual freedom. If these
Americans could use their knowledge intelligently to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
make that amazing Constitution to protect our human
liberty and their own, it cannot be beyond us, now
also taught by their experience, to understand the protection
which that Constitution gave to them and gives
to us against even the usurpation of our own governments.
Only by that understanding may we hope to
keep that legacy of protection. No longer, now that
we have acquired that understanding, can we make
the great mistake of believing that the public leaders
or lawyers of this generation are qualified to teach us
anything about that protection.</p>

<p>The experience of our leaders and lawyers has given
them an entirely different education, in the science of
government, than was the education of these earlier
average Americans and <i>their</i> leaders, than is our own
education in having lived over again the days in which
all valid grants of national power in constitutions of
American government were made by the people themselves
<i>because</i> people and governments alike knew that
<i>such</i> grants could never be made by governments. The
experience of public leaders and lawyers in America,
for the past thirty years, has been almost exclusively
concerned with property and with law and Constitutions
in relation to property.</p>

<p>In the Supreme Court, in the Slaughter House
Cases, 16 <i>Wall.</i> 36 at page 116, Justice Bradley points
out that the Declaration of Independence was the first
political act of the American people in their independent
sovereign capacity and that therein they laid the
foundation of <i>national</i> existence on the basic principle
that men are created with equal and inalienable rights
to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” He
then goes on to state that “Rights to life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness are equivalent to the rights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
of life, liberty, and property.” We thus realize that
the education of the Americans, who made all our
constitutions, trained them to make Articles of government
which would secure protected enjoyment of
these three human rights. And we have learned that
to those Americans, life and liberty came before property
in importance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the leaders and lawyers of the
present generation have been educated to think that
<i>property</i> is the one important right which constitutions
are made to protect. Wherefore it would be extraordinary
if any of them knew that the American people
constituted all their governments, and made their distribution
of <i>national</i> powers among those governments
and reserved to themselves many <i>national</i> powers, all
for the main purpose of securing individual life and
liberty, and <i>then</i>, the enjoyment of property. That
these leaders and lawyers, so educated by experience,
have not known these things or understood at all the
constitutional Articles, an accurate understanding of
whose meaning depends upon a knowledge which their
education has withheld from them, the story of the
last five years amply demonstrates. In its detail, that
story and that demonstration will be later dwelt upon
herein.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we average Americans of this generation
have not received any <i>wrong</i> education in the
relative importance of human life and liberty to property
in the eyes of the American people who constituted
all governments in America, and in the constitutions
which those people made to secure all three
human rights against even the usurpations of delegated
power by the very governments which those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
constitutions created. Our wrong education in that
respect has undoubtedly been attempted. The events
of the last five years, however, while demonstrating
the thoroughly wrong education of our leaders, have
also shown that the average Americans still sense
something extraordinary about governments exercising
undelegated power over citizens of which they are not
the governments and about governments claiming ability
to give to themselves and to other governments undelegated
<i>national</i> powers to interfere with individual
human freedom. It has been entirely the result of the
wrong education of our leaders and “constitutional”
lawyers that we have not been told the legal fact <i>that</i>,
and the constitutional reason <i>why</i>, these extraordinary
performances on the part of governments in America
have been just as void as they are extraordinary.</p>

<p>Now that we have turned from the unsound teaching
of those wrongly educated leaders and lawyers and
have educated ourselves by living with the earlier
Americans through their making of all our constitutions
of government, we are ready to approach, with
clear and understanding minds, a brief consideration
of the great Constitution proposed at Philadelphia and
made by the citizens of America. Only by such brief
but accurate consideration can we ever realize the
distribution of delegated <i>national</i> powers between a
supreme government—legislating for all American
citizens—and lesser governments, each legislating only
for its own citizens and without any power to legislate
for American citizens. Only by such consideration
can we realize the importance to us of the legal fact
that the citizens of America, when making that distribution
of granted national powers, reserved to themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
alone all other <i>national</i> powers to legislate for
<i>American</i> citizens except those national powers granted
and enumerated in Article I of our Constitution to the
only national government of the citizens of America.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br><span class="small">THE CONVENTIONS GIVE THE CONSENT</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The proposal which came from Philadelphia in
1787 was absolutely without precedent in history.
Simply stated it was that, outside of all written law
save the Statute of ’76, the entire American people,
who were not one nation or its citizens, should make
themselves one nation and the supreme nation in America;
that, simultaneously with the birth of this new
nation, they should destroy the complete independence
of each existing society or nation, in some one of which
each American was a member or citizen, but keep alive
each such society or former nation, subject to the
supreme will of the citizens of the new nation; that
they should keep alive the federation of those old
nations also subject to the supreme will of the citizens
of the new nation; that they should leave with each
former nation (now to be a subordinate state) and to
its citizens much of its own and their own national
power to govern themselves on many matters without
interference from any government or governments outside
of that state; that they should leave with those
continuing states and <i>their</i> governments their existing
and limited ability to give <i>federal</i> power to government
by making <i>federal</i> Articles in the Constitution
of <i>federal</i> government; that they should, as the citizens
of America, give to no state or states or <i>their</i> respective
governments any new power of any kind, leaving
to the citizens of each state to determine (within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
limits fixed by the Constitution of the American citizens)
how much power its own national government
should have to interfere with the individual freedom
of its own citizens; that—most unique and marvelous
conception of all—these citizens of America, simultaneously
with the birth of the new nation and in their
capacity as its citizens, should grant to its government,
the only government of those citizens of America, definite
and enumerated <i>national</i> powers to interfere with
their individual freedom; and that—probably the most
important and the least remembered feature of the
whole proposal—all other possible national powers
over themselves, as citizens of America, should be reserved
exclusively to themselves and be exercised or
granted by them alone, “in the only manner in which
they can act safely, <i>effectively</i>, and wisely, <i>on such a
subject</i>, by assembling in Convention.” (Marshall, in
the Supreme Court, M’Culloch v. Maryland, 4 <i>Wheat.</i>
316.)</p>

<p>We have not forgotten that these Americans, to
whom that proposal was made, did act upon it in that
only <i>effective</i> way, by assembling in their conventions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the formation of a league, such as was the Confederation,
the state sovereignties were certainly competent.
But when, “in order to form a more perfect Union,” it
was deemed necessary to change this alliance into an effective
government, possessing great and sovereign powers,
and acting directly on the people, the necessity of referring
it to the people, <i>and of deriving its powers directly from
them</i>, was felt and acknowledged by all. The government
of the Union, then, (whatever may be the influence of this
fact on the case,) is, emphatically, and truly, a government
of the people. In form and in substance it emanates from
them. <i>Its powers are granted by them</i>, and are to be exercised
directly on them, and for their benefit. (Marshall,
M’Culloch v. Maryland, 4 <i>Wheat.</i> 316.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>In view of the startling fact that <i>our</i> leaders and
“constitutional” lawyers have neither felt nor acknowledged
the necessity that <i>new</i> national powers of that
government, new powers to interfere directly with the
individual freedom of <i>its</i> citizens, must be derived “directly”
from those citizens, in the only effective way
in which they can act, on such a subject, by assembling
in their conventions, it is the duty of ourselves, the
average American citizens of this generation, to insist
that <i>they</i> learn this legal fact. When <i>they</i> shall have
learned what all Americans once knew, the freedom of
the American individual will be as secure as it was in
1790. No legislature, no matter whence comes a suggestion
to the contrary, will dare to issue any command
except to its own citizens, and only to them in
matters on which those citizens have granted power to
that legislature to command them.</p>

<p>That we may intelligently so insist, and that our insistence
may be made in the proper place and at the
proper time, let us briefly consider on what subjects,
in the making of our Constitution, our predecessors,
as American citizens, granted their enumerated national
powers to our only government of all Americans.
Like those predecessors, assembled in their conventions,
we find all those enumerated powers in the First Article
of the Constitution proposed from Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In substance they are the war power; the power of
making treaties; the power of regulating commerce between
ourselves and all people outside of America and
between the citizens of the different states; the power
of taxation; and all other incidental and supplementary
powers necessary to make laws in the execution of
these enumerated and granted powers.</p>

<p>Noticeably absent from these enumerated powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
granted to the only general government of the citizens
of America is that power, then existing and still in the
national government of each nation or state, known
(rather inaccurately) as the police power or the power
to pass any law, in restraint of individual human freedom,
reasonably designed, <i>in the judgment of that particular
legislature</i>, to promote the general welfare of
its own citizens. It seems hardly necessary, at this
moment, to refer to the innumerable decisions of the
Supreme Court that such power was not among those
enumerated and granted to the American government
by <i>its</i> citizens. It was solely because such power had
definitely not been granted by them to it that <i>the</i> government
of the American citizens made its famous
proposal that a portion of such power, in relation to
one subject, be granted to it in the supposed Eighteenth
Amendment of our Constitution.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the police power of any government
is really all its power to pass any laws which
interfere with the exercise of individual freedom. In
that respect, the American people made a marked
distinction between the quantum <i>of that kind</i> of power
which they <i>granted</i> to their one general national government
and the quantum they <i>left</i> in the national
government of the citizens of each state. The quantum
they granted to their own government was
definitely enumerated in the First Article. On the
other hand, except for the limitations which they themselves
imposed upon the respective governments of
each state, they left the citizens of each state to determine
what quantum the government of that state
should have.</p>

<p>In other words, the police power of the American
Congress is strictly limited to the enumerated powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
<i>of that kind</i> granted by the citizens of America. And,
although the fact does not seem to be generally known,
it is <i>because</i> the First Article vests in the sole Legislature
of the whole American people nothing but
<i>enumerated</i> powers to interfere with the freedom of
the individual American that our American government
has received its universal tribute as a government
of nothing but enumerated powers over a free
people, who are its citizens.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the Constitution are provisions in separate Articles for
the three great departments of government,—legislative,
executive, and judicial. But there is this significant difference
in the grants of powers to these departments: the
First Article, treating of legislative powers, does not make
a general grant of legislative power. It reads: “Article
one, section one. All legislative powers herein granted shall
be vested in a Congress,” etc.; and then, in Article 8, mentions
and defines the legislative powers that are granted.
By reason of the fact that there is no general grant of legislative
power it has become an accepted constitutional rule
that this is a government of enumerated powers. (Justice
Brewer, in the Supreme Court, Kansas v. Colorado, 206
<i>U. S.</i> 46.)</p>
</div>

<p>Among the <i>national</i> powers, which <i>are</i> enumerated
in the First Article, there is one which (<i>whenever
operative</i>) approximates the extensive police power of
a state government to interfere with the freedom of
its citizens. That is the war power of the Government
of America. As the purpose of the Constitution of
the American Government is to protect the freedom
of the American and as such freedom needs effective
protection from foreign attack, the Americans of that
earlier generation made the war power of their government
almost as unlimited as that of a despotic government.
All history and their own human experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
had taught them that the war power, if it was to be
effective for their protection, must be practically unlimited.
If we grasp this extent of the <i>American</i> war
power, we realize why our sole American government,
without the grant of a new <i>national</i> power to it, could
validly enact what we know as the War Time Prohibition
Statute, although without such a new grant, it was
powerless to enact what we know as the Volstead Act
or National Prohibition for time of peace. It is because
the citizens of each state, in <i>their</i> Constitution
of <i>their</i> national government, had given to it a general
(although specifically limited) ability to interfere with
their own human freedom in most matters, that each
state government could validly make prohibition laws
for its own citizens. It is because the <i>American</i> citizens
had not given to <i>their</i> government any such
general ability to interfere with <i>their</i> freedom, that the
<i>American</i> Government, for any time except that of
war, could not validly enact National Prohibition for
the American people without a new grant of a new
<i>national</i> power directly from its own citizens. In the
days of those earlier Americans, the <i>legal</i> necessity of
deriving <i>such</i> power <i>directly</i> from the <i>American</i> citizens
themselves was “felt and acknowledged by all.”
In our day, among our leaders and our “constitutional”
lawyers, there was none so humble as to know or honor
this basic legal necessity.</p>

<p>The other enumerated <i>national</i> powers, which
American citizens <i>ever</i> gave their national government,
are few in number, although they vested a vast
and necessary ability in that government to protect the
freedom of its citizens and promote their happiness
and welfare by laws in certain matters. For our
present purpose, they need only be mentioned. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
require no present explanation. They are the power
to make all treaties with foreign nations or governments;
the power to regulate commerce, except the
commerce within any one particular state; and the
power of taxation.</p>

<p>Having now some accurate conception of the limited
and specific quantum of <i>national</i> power which American
citizens consented to grant in those earlier days, it
is pertinent to our inquiry, as to whether we (their
posterity) have again become subjects, to dwell briefly
upon the reluctance with which they made even those
grants. In considering that attitude, it is essential
always to keep in mind the status of the citizens of each
state, at that time, and their relation to their own
<i>national</i> government and the relation of each state to
the <i>federal</i> government of all the states. Under the
existing system of governments, the citizens of each
state were subject to no valid interference whatever
with their own individual freedom except by laws of a
legislature, <i>every</i> member of which they themselves
elected and to which they themselves granted every
power of <i>such</i> interference which that legislature could
validly exercise. To those free men in those free
states, men educated in the knowledge of what is real
republican self-government, these two facts meant the
utmost security of their human rights. No government
or governments in the world, except their own one
state government could interfere at all directly with
those rights, and they <i>had given to</i>, and they could take
from, that government <i>any</i> power of that kind. As for
the respective states and the relation of each to the
federal government of all, each state had an <i>equal</i>
voice in the giving to or taking from that government
any <i>federal</i> power and each had an equal voice, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
the <i>federal</i> legislature, in exercising each valid <i>federal</i>
power. These existing facts, respectively of vast importance
to the citizens of each state and to its
government, influenced, more than any other facts,
the framing of the new Articles, particularly the First
Article, at Philadelphia and the opposition to those
Articles in the conventions in which the people of
America assembled.</p>

<p>The First Article, as we know it, starts with the
explicit statement that all <i>national</i> powers, which are
granted by Americans in that Constitution, are granted
<i>to</i> the only <i>American</i> legislature, Congress. It then
provides how the members of each of the two bodies
in that legislature shall be elected. It then enumerates
the granted powers, confining them to specific subjects
of interference with the human freedom of the American
citizen. It then, for the particular security of that
human freedom, imposes specific restraints upon that
legislature even in the exercise of its granted national
powers. Finally, it prohibits the further exercise of
specific powers by any state government.</p>

<p>No American, who reads the debates of the Philadelphia
Convention of 1787, can fail to realize that
the grant of any <i>national</i> power,—power to interfere
with human freedom—<i>is</i> the constitution of government.
The First Article was the subject of almost
all the discussion of those four months at Philadelphia.
Seemingly invincible differences of desire and opinion,
as to who should elect and the proportion (for citizens
of the new nation and for states of the continuing
federation) in which there should be elected the members
of the legislature which was to exercise the
granted <i>national</i> powers, almost ended the effort of
that Convention. This was in the early part of July.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
For exhausting days patriotic men had struggled to
reconcile the conflict of desire and opinion in that
respect. One element, mainly from the larger states,
insisted that the members (from each state) of both
branches of the new legislature should be proportioned
to the number of Americans in that state. The other
element, mainly from the smaller states, insisted that
the Americans in each state should have an equal representation
in each branch of the new legislature. Each
element was further divided as to who should choose
the members of that legislature. Some held that the
people should choose every member. Others held that
the state legislatures should choose every member.
Still others held that each state should, by its legislature,
choose the members of one branch, so that those
members might speak for that state, and that the
American people themselves, divided into districts,
should choose the members of the other branch, so
that those members might speak for the general citizens
of America.</p>

<p>Mason of Virginia, later one of the great opponents
of the adoption of all the Articles, insisted that election
by the people was “the only security for the rights of
the people.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 223.)</p>

<p>Madison “considered an election of one branch, at
least of the legislature by the people immediately, as a
clear principle of free government.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i>
161.)</p>

<p>Wilson of Pennsylvania “wished for vigor in the
government, but he wished that vigorous authority to
flow immediately from the legitimate source of all
authority.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 160.) Later he said, “If
we are to establish a <i>national</i> government, that government
ought to flow from the people at large. If one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
branch of it should be chosen by the legislatures, and
the other by the people, the two branches will rest on
different foundations, and dissensions will naturally
arise between them.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 167.)</p>

<p>Dickenson of Delaware “considered it <i>essential</i> that
one branch of the legislature should be drawn immediately
from the people, and <i>expedient</i> that the other
should be chosen by the legislatures of the states.”
(5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 163.)</p>

<p>Gerry of Massachusetts, consistent Tory in his
mental attitude toward the relation of government to
people, insisted that “the commercial and moneyed
interest would be more secure in the hands of the state
legislatures than of the people at large. The former
have more sense of character, and will be restrained
by that from injustice.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 169.)</p>

<p>On June 25, Wilson, at some length, opposed the
election of senators by the state legislatures. He stated
that: “He was opposed to an election by state legislatures.
In explaining his reasons, it was necessary to
observe the two-fold relation in which the people
would stand—first, as citizens of the general government;
and, secondly, as citizens of their particular
state. The general government was meant for them
in the first capacity; the state governments in the
second. Both governments were derived from the
people; both meant for the people; both therefore
ought to be regulated on the same principles....
The general government is not an assemblage
of states, but of individuals, for certain political
purposes. It is not meant for the states, but for the
individuals composing them; the <i>individuals</i>, therefore,
not the <i>states</i>, ought to be represented in it.” (5
<i>Ell. Deb.</i> 239.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>There came a day, early in that memorable July,
when all hope of continuing the Convention was almost
abandoned, by reason of the difference of desire and
opinion on this one subject. Let us average Americans
of this generation remember that this one subject was
merely the decision whether the people were to choose
all the members of the legislature which was to exercise
granted national powers to interfere with the human
freedom of the citizens of America. Happily for all
of us, there were many patriotic as well as able leaders
at Philadelphia. From their patriotism and ability
they evolved the compromise, on that question, which
is expressed in their First Article. When it came from
Philadelphia, it provided that each state should have
equal representation in the Senate, senators to be
chosen by the state legislatures, and that the House of
Representatives should consist of members chosen
directly by the citizens of America, in districts proportioned
to the number of those citizens in it.</p>

<p>No one has read the recorded debates of the Convention
which proposed and the conventions which
adopted our Constitution without learning that the
Americans in those conventions knew that the grant
of enumerated <i>national</i> powers in the First Article
<span class="allsmcap">WAS</span> the constitution of the <i>American</i> government of
men. In and out of the Philadelphia Convention, the
greatest and most persistent attack upon its proposal
was the insistent claim that it had acted wholly without
authority in proposing an Article which purported to
grant <i>any</i> such <i>national</i> power to interfere with the
human freedom of all Americans. Since July 4, 1776,
no legislature or legislatures in the world had possessed
<i>any national</i> powers over all Americans. The
Americans in each existing nation elected every member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
of the one legislature which had any such power
over them. It was felt and stated at Philadelphia, it
was felt and urged and insisted upon, sometimes with
decency and reason, sometimes with bitterness and
rancor and hatred, between the closing day at Philadelphia
and the assembling of various Americans in
each state, that the Americans in each state would be
unwilling to give <i>any</i> such <i>national</i> power over themselves
to any legislature whose members were not all
elected by the people in that state. In all the conventions
which adopted the Constitution, the one great
object of attack was the grant even of <i>enumerated</i>
powers of a <i>national</i> kind to a legislature whose members
would not all be chosen by the Americans in the
state in which the convention was held. The record
of the Virginia convention fills one entire volume of
Elliot’s Debates. Almost one-half of the pages of that
volume are claimed by the eloquent attacks of Patrick
Henry upon those grants of enumerated powers in that
First Article. The basis of all his argument was the
fact that this grant of national power in the First
Article would make him and all his fellow Virginians,
for the first time since the Declaration of Independence,
citizens of a nation—<i>not Virginia</i>—who must
obey the laws of a legislature only some of whose
members Virginians would elect.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” he says, “the people of Virginia should
wish to alter” this new government which governs
them. “Can a majority of them do it? No; because
they are connected with other men, or, in other words,
consolidated with other states. When the people of
Virginia, at a future day, shall wish to alter their government,
though they should be unanimous in this
desire, yet they may be prevented therefrom by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
despicable minority at the extremity of the United
States. The founders of your own Constitution made
your government changeable: but the power of changing
it is gone from you. Whither is it gone? It is
placed in the same hands that hold the rights of twelve
other states; and those who hold those rights have
right and power to keep them. It is not the particular
government of Virginia: one of the leading features of
that government is, that a majority can alter it, when
necessary for the public good. This government is not
a Virginian, but an American government.” (3 <i>Ell.
Deb.</i> 55.)</p>

<p>How forceful and effective was this objection, we
average Americans of this generation may well realize
when we know that the Constitution was ratified in
Virginia by the scant majority of ten votes. In New
York and Massachusetts and other states, the adoption
was secured by similar small majorities. In North
Carolina, the first convention refused to adopt at all.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is recorded history that, in Massachusetts,
in Virginia, in New York, and elsewhere, the
vote of the people would have been against the adoption
of the Constitution, if a promise had not been
made to them by the advocates of the Constitution. It
was the historic promise that Congress, under the
<i>mode of procedure</i> prescribed in Article V, would propose
new <i>declaratory</i> Articles, suggested by the various
conventions and specifically securing certain <i>reserved</i>
rights and powers of all Americans from all ability of
<i>government</i> to interfere therewith. This historic
promise was fulfilled, when the first Congress of the
new nation proposed the suggested declaratory Articles
and ten of them were adopted. These are the
Articles now known as the first ten Amendments. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
has been settled beyond dispute, in the Supreme Court,
that every one of the declarations in these ten Articles
was already in the Constitution when it was originally
adopted by the citizens of America.</p>

<p>The most important declaration in those amazingly
important ten declarations, which secured the adoption
of our Constitution, is the plain statement that every
<i>national</i> power to interfere with the human freedom of
Americans, not granted in Article I, was reserved to
the American people themselves in their capacity as
the citizens of America. That is the explicit statement
of what we know as the Tenth Amendment. In itself,
that statement was but the plain and accurate echo of
what was stated by the American people (who made
the enumerated grants of such powers in Article I) in
the conventions where they made those grants. Their
statement was nowhere more accurately expressed, in
that respect, than in the resolution of the Virginia
Convention, which ratified the Constitution. That
resolution began, “Whereas the powers granted under
the proposed constitution are the gift of the <span class="allsmcap">PEOPLE</span>,
and every power <span class="allsmcap">NOT GRANTED</span> thereby remains with
<span class="allsmcap">THEM</span>, and at <span class="allsmcap">THEIR</span> will, etc.” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 653.)</p>

<p>After the same statement had been expressly made
(with authoritative effect as part of the original Constitution)
in that Article which we know as the Tenth
Amendment, it was again and again echoed, in the
plainest language, from the Bench of the Supreme
Court.</p>

<p>As far back as 1795, in the case of Vanhorne’s
Lessee vs. Dorrance, 2 <i>Dall.</i> 304, Justice Patterson
stated that the Constitution of England is at the mercy
of Parliament, but “in America, the case is widely different.”...
A Constitution “is the form of government,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
delineated by the mighty hand of the people, in
which certain first principles of fundamental laws are
established. The Constitution is certain and fixed; it
contains the permanent will of the people, and is the
supreme law of the land; it is paramount to the power
of the legislature, and can be revoked or altered only
by the authority that made it. The life-giving principle
and the death-dealing stroke must proceed from the
same hand.... The Constitution fixes limits to the
exercise of legislative authority, and prescribes the
orbit within which it must move.... Whatever may
be the case in other countries, yet in this there can be
no doubt, that every act of the legislature, repugnant to
the Constitution, is absolutely void.”</p>

<p>To us average Americans, who have lived with
those earlier Americans through the days in which they
constituted their nation and distributed all <i>granted</i>
national powers between governments <i>in</i> America and
<i>reserved</i> all other <i>general</i> American national powers
exclusively to themselves, the Virginia Resolution, the
Tenth Amendment, and the quoted language of the
Circuit Court are in strict conformity with the education
<i>we</i> have received.</p>

<p>What, however, are we to think of the Tory
education of so many of <i>our</i> leaders and “constitutional”
lawyers, who have calmly accepted and acted
upon the amazing assumption that state governments
in America can exercise and can grant to other governments
any or all <i>general</i> national powers to interfere
with the human freedom of American citizens, including
even the national powers expressly reserved by
those citizens to <i>themselves</i> in the Tenth Amendment?</p>

<p>If they adopt their familiar mental attitude that all
these statements were made more than a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
years ago and have no meaning or weight now, we
refer them to the Supreme Court, in 1907, when it
stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The powers the people have given to the General Government
are named in the Constitution, and all not there
named, either expressly or by implication, are reserved to
<span class="allsmcap">THE PEOPLE</span> and can be exercised only by <span class="allsmcap">THEM</span>, or <span class="allsmcap">UPON
FURTHER</span> grant from them. (Justice Brewer in Turner
v. Williams, 194, <i>U. S.</i> 279.)</p>
</div>

<p>For ourselves, we average Americans turn now to
examine in detail how clearly the Americans at Philadelphia
in 1787 <i>did</i> know and obey the basic law of
America that all <i>national</i> powers to interfere with individual
freedom are the powers of the people themselves
and can be exercised only by them or upon direct
grant from them. We find their knowledge, in that
respect, evidenced by an examination of the reasoning
by which they reached the correct legal conclusion that
their proposed grants of general national powers, in
their First Article, could only be made by the citizens
of America themselves, assembled in their “conventions”—that
grants of <i>such</i> powers could not be made
even by all the legislatures of the then independent
states.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is no longer open to question that by the Constitution
a nation was brought into being, and that that instrument
was not merely operative to establish a closer union or
league of states. (Justice Brewer, in Supreme Court,
Kansas v. Colorado, 206 <i>U. S.</i> 46 at page 80.)</p>
</div>


<p>Instructed by living through the education of
the earlier Americans to their making of that Constitution,
we accurately know that they themselves,
<i>by their own direct action</i>, brought that new nation
into being. Through <i>our</i> course in <i>their</i> education, we
have <i>their</i> knowledge that only the men, who are to be
its first members, can create a new political society of
men, which is exactly what any American nation is.
“Individuals entering into society must give up a share
of liberty to preserve the rest.” So said the letter
which went from Philadelphia with the proposed Articles
whose later adoption created the new nation and
vested the delegated and enumerated national powers
of its government to interfere with the liberty of its
citizens, (1 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 17.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, through our own personal experience,
we understand how all societies of men are brought
into being. There are few of us who have not participated
in the creation of at least one society of men.
Most of us have personally participated in the creation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
of many such societies. For which reason, we are
quite well acquainted with the manner in which all
societies of men are brought into being. We know
that ourselves, the prospective members of the proposed
society, assemble and organize it and become its
first members and constitute the powers of its government
to command us, its members, for the achievement
of the purpose for which we create it.</p>

<p>For one simple reason, the Americans, through
whose education we have just lived, were “better
acquainted with the science of government than any
other people in the world.” That reason was their
accurate knowledge that a free nation, like any other
society of individuals, can be created only in the same
manner and by its prospective members and that the
gift of any <i>national</i> powers to its government can only
be by direct grant from its human members. This is
the surrender “of a share of their liberty, to preserve
the rest.”</p>

<p>The knowledge of those Americans is now our
knowledge. For which reason, we know that they
<i>themselves</i> created that new nation and immediately
became its citizens and, <i>as such</i>, gave to its government
all the valid and enumerated national powers of that
government to interfere with their and our human
freedom. We know that they did all these things, by
their own direct action, “in the only manner, in which
they can act safely, <i>effectively</i> or wisely, on such a subject,
by assembling in conventions.”</p>

<p>Thus, whatever may have been the lack of knowledge
on the part of our leaders and “constitutional”
lawyers for the last five years, we ourselves know, with
knowledge that is a certainty, that the ratifying conventions
of 1787 and 1788 <span class="allsmcap">WERE</span> the American people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
themselves or the citizens of the new nation, America,
assembled in their respective states.</p>

<p>Our Supreme Court has always had the same knowledge
and acted upon it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Constitution of the United States was ordained and
established, not by the states in their sovereign capacities
[the respective peoples or citizens of each State] but emphatically,
as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by
“the people of the United States” [namely the one people
of America].... It was competent to the people to invest
the general government with all the powers which <i>they</i>
might deem proper and necessary; to extend or restrain
these powers according to their own good pleasure, and
to give them a paramount and supreme authority....
The people had a right to prohibit to the states the exercise
of any powers which were, in <i>their</i> judgment, incompatible
with the objects of the general compact [between
the citizens or members of the new nation], to make the
powers of the state governments, in given cases, subordinate
to those of the nation, or to reserve to <i>themselves</i> those
sovereign authorities which <i>they</i> might not choose to delegate
to either. (Supreme Court, Martin v. Hunter’s
Lessee, 1 <i>Wheat.</i> 304, at p. 324.)</p>

<p>Instructed by experience, the <i>American people</i>, in the
conventions of their respective states, adopted the present
Constitution.... The <i>people</i> made the Constitution
and the people can unmake it. It is the creature of <i>their</i>
will, and lives only by <i>their</i> will. But this supreme and
irresistible power to make or to unmake resides only in
the <i>whole</i> body of the people, not in any subdivisions of
them. (Marshall, in Supreme Court, Cohens v. Virginia,
6 <i>Wheat.</i> 264.)</p>

<p>The Constitution was ordained and established <i>by the
people</i> of the United States for themselves, for their own
government, and not for the government of the individual
states. Each state established a constitution for itself, and
in that constitution provided such limitations and restrictions
on the powers of its particular government as its
judgment dictated. <i>The people of the United States</i> framed
<i>such</i> a government for the United States as <i>they</i> supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
best adapted to <i>their</i> situation, and best calculated to promote
<i>their</i> interests. The powers <i>they</i> conferred on this
government were to be exercised by itself; and the limitations
on power, if expressed in general terms, are naturally,
and, we think, necessarily, applicable to the government
created by the instrument. They are limitations of power
granted in the instrument itself; not of distinct governments,
framed by <i>different persons</i> and for different purposes.
(Marshall, in Supreme Court, Barron v. Mayor
of Baltimore, 7 <i>Peters</i>, 243.)</p>

<p>When the <i>American people</i> created a <i>national</i> legislature,
with certain enumerated powers, it was neither necessary
nor proper to define the powers retained by the states.
These powers proceed, not from the people of America,
<i>but from the people of the several states</i>; and remain, after
the adoption of the Constitution, what they were before,
except so far as they may be abridged by that instrument.
(Marshall, in the Supreme Court, Sturges v. Crowninshield,
4 <i>Wheat.</i> 122.)</p>
</div>

<p>We average Americans know <i>and will remember</i> the
clear distinction, the <i>substantial</i> distinction, recognized
by the great jurist, between “the people of America”
and “the people of the several states,” although they
happen to be the same human beings acting in different
capacities, as members of different political societies
of men. It is a matter of constant mention in the
Supreme Court that we ourselves, in addition to our
capacity as human beings, have two other distinct
capacities, that of citizen of America and that of citizen
of our respective state; that, as citizens of
America, we alone validly give to <i>its</i> government any
power to command us, and, as citizens of our particular
state, we alone validly give to <i>its</i> government all its
national power to command us. The decisions of the
Supreme Court, in that respect, are mentioned elsewhere
herein. Meanwhile, we average Americans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
understand these matters perfectly <i>and will not forget
them</i>. We are quite accustomed, while retaining our
status as free human beings, to be members of many
different societies of men and, as the members of some
particular society, to give to its government certain
powers to interfere with our freedom.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have in our political system a government of the
United States and a government of each of the several
states. Each one of these governments is distinct from the
others, and each has citizens of its own who owe it allegiance,
and whose rights, within its jurisdiction, it must
protect. The same person may be at the same time a citizen
of the United States and a citizen of a state, but his rights
of citizenship under one of these governments will be different
from those he has under the other.... Experience
made the fact known to <i>the people of the United States</i> that
<i>they</i> required a national government for national purposes....
For this reason, the people of the United States ...
ordained and established the government of the United
States, and defined its powers by a Constitution, which they
adopted as its fundamental law, and made its rules of action.
The government thus established and defined is to some
extent a government of the states in their political capacity.
It is also, for certain purposes, a government of the people.
Its powers are limited in number, but not in degree.
Within the scope of its powers, as enumerated and defined,
it is supreme and above the states; but beyond, it has no
existence. It was erected for special purposes and endowed
with all the powers necessary for its own preservation
and the accomplishment of the ends its people had in
view.... The people of the United States resident
within any state are subject to two governments, one state,
and the other <i>national</i>; but there need be no conflict between
the two. Powers which one possesses, the other does
not. They are established for different purposes, and have
separate jurisdictions. Together they make one whole, and
furnish the people of the United States with a complete
government, ample for the protection of all their rights
at home and abroad. (Justice Waite, in Supreme Court,
United States v. Cruikshank, 92 <i>U. S.</i> 542.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>It must seem remarkable to us average Americans,
with the education we have acquired at this point, to
realize that <i>our</i> leaders and “constitutional” lawyers
have not known <i>why</i> only we ourselves, in our capacity
as citizens of America, can give any new national
power to interfere with our freedom and that we, for
such new giving, must act, in the only way in which the
citizens of America “<i>can</i> act safely, <span class="allsmcap">EFFECTIVELY</span>,
or wisely, on such a subject, by assembling in convention,”
in our respective states, the very “conventions”
mentioned for valid grant of such <i>national</i> power in
the Fifth Article of the Constitution made by the citizens
of America, so assembled in such “conventions.”
Before dwelling briefly upon the accurate appreciation
of that legal fact displayed by those first citizens in
everything connected with the making of that Constitution
and that Fifth Article, let us realize how well
the leaders and great constitutional lawyers of other
American generations between that day and our own
<i>did</i> know this settled legal fact.</p>

<p>After the Americans <i>in</i> nine states had created the
new nation and had become its citizens and had (in
that capacity) granted the <i>national</i> powers of its First
Article, the Americans in Virginia assembled to determine
whether they also would become citizens of
the new nation. As the president of the convention,
in which they assembled, they chose Edmund Pendleton,
then Chancellor of Virginia.</p>

<p>Very early in the debates, Henry and Mason, great
opponents of the Constitution, attacked it on the
ground that its Preamble showed that it was to be
made by the people of America and not by the states,
each of which was then an independent people. Henry
and Mason wanted those peoples to remain independent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
They wanted no new nation but a continuance
of a mere union of independent nations. They
knew that a constitution of government ordained and
established by the one people of America, assembled
in their respective “conventions,” as the Preamble of
this Constitution showed <i>it</i> to be, created an American
nation and made the ratifying Americans, in each state,
the citizens of that new nation. For this reason, the
opening thunder of Henry’s eloquence was on that
Preamble. “My political curiosity, exclusive of my
anxious solicitude for the public welfare, leads me to
ask, Who authorized them to speak the language of
<i>We, the people</i>, instead of, <i>We, the states</i>? States are
the characteristics and the soul of a confederation. If
the states be not the agents of this compact, it must be
one great, consolidated, <i>national</i> government, of the
people of all the states.” (Henry, 3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 22.)</p>

<p>The learned Pendleton, sound in his knowledge of
basic American law and quick to grasp the plain meaning
of the Fifth Article of the new Constitution, quickly
answered Henry. “Where is the cause of alarm? We,
the people, <i>possessing all power</i>, form a government,
such as we think will secure happiness; and suppose,
in adopting this plan, we should be mistaken in the
end; where is the cause of alarm on that quarter? In
the same plan we point out an easy and quiet method
of reforming what may be found amiss. No, but say
gentlemen, we have put the <i>introduction</i> of that
method in the hands of our servants, who will interrupt
it for motives of self-interest. What then?...
Who shall dare to resist the people? No, we will
assemble in convention; wholly recall our delegated
powers or reform them so as to prevent such abuse;
and punish those servants who have perverted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
powers, designed for our happiness, to their own
emolument.... But an objection is made to the
form; the expression, We, the people, is thought improper.
Permit me to ask the gentlemen who made
this objection, <span class="allsmcap">WHO BUT THE PEOPLE CAN DELEGATE
POWERS?</span> Who but the people have the right to form
government?... <i>What have the state governments
to do with it?</i>” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 37.)</p>

<p>We average Americans know and will remember
that this learned American lawyer, only twelve years
earlier a <i>subject</i> of an omnipotent legislature, already
knew the basic American principle to be that the delegation
of <i>national</i> power <i>was</i> the constitution of government
of a free people and that only the people,
assembled in convention, could delegate such power
and that the state governments, under basic American
law, never can have the ability to delegate <i>that kind</i>
of power. We regret that <i>our</i> “constitutional” lawyers,
all born free citizens of a free republic, have not
the same accurate knowledge of basic American law.</p>

<p>But the knowledge of Henry and of Pendleton, that
the document under consideration was the Constitution
of a nation whose citizens alone could give to its government
any valid power to interfere with their human
freedom, was the knowledge of all in that and the
other “conventions,” in which the one people of
America assembled and adopted that Constitution.
Let us note another distinct type in that Virginia convention,
the famous Light-horse Harry Lee of the
Revolution. “Descended from one of the oldest and
most honorable families in the colony, a graduate of
Princeton College, one of the most daring, picturesque,
and attractive officers of the Revolution, in which by
sheer gallantry and military genius he had become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
commander of a famous cavalry command, the gallant
Lee was a perfect contrast to the venerable Pendleton.”
(Beveridge, <i>Life of Marshall</i>, Vol. I, page
387.) Lee also replied to Henry’s attack on the expression
“We, the people” and not “We, the states.”
In his reply, there was shown the same accurate
knowledge of basic American law. “This expression
was introduced into that paper with great propriety.
This system is submitted <i>to the people</i> for their consideration,
because on them it is to operate, if adopted.
It is not binding on the people until it becomes their
act.” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 42.)</p>

<p>In the Massachusetts convention, General William
Heath, another soldier of the Revolution, showed his
accurate conception of the legal fact of which we
average Americans have just been reading in the decisions
of our Supreme Court. “Mr. President, I
consider myself not as an inhabitant of Massachusetts,
but as a citizen of the United States.” (2 <i>Ell. Deb.</i>
12.)</p>

<p>In the North Carolina convention, William Goudy
seems to have had some prophetic vision of our own
immediate day. Speaking of the document under discussion
and clearly having in mind its First Article, this
is the warning he gave us: “Its intent is a concession of
power, on the part of the people, to their rulers. We
know that private interest governs mankind generally.
Power belongs originally to the people; but if rulers
[all governments] be not well guarded, that power
may be usurped from them. People ought to be
cautious in giving away power.... Power is generally
taken from the people by imposing on their
understanding, or by fetters.” (4 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 10.)</p>

<p>In that same North Carolina convention, James<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
Iredell, later a distinguished judge of our Supreme
Court, in replying to the common attack that the Constitution
contained no Bill of Rights, displayed clearly
the general accurate knowledge that, in America, any
grant of <i>national</i> power to interfere with human freedom
<i>is</i> the constitution of government and that the
citizens of any nation in America are <i>not</i> citizens but
subjects, <i>if</i> even a single power <i>of that kind</i> is exercised
by government without its grant directly from the
citizens themselves, assembled in their conventions.
“Of what use, therefore, can a Bill of Rights be in <i>this</i>
Constitution, where the <i>people</i> expressly declare how
much power <i>they</i> do give, and consequently retain all
that they do not? It is a declaration of particular
powers <i>by the people</i> to their representatives, for particular
purposes. It may be considered as a great
power of attorney, under which no power can be exercised
but what is expressly given.” (4 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 148.)</p>

<p>When we average Americans read the debates of
those human beings, the first citizens of America, one
thing steadily amazes us, as we contrast it with all that
we have heard during the past five years. Some of
those first citizens were distinguished lawyers or statesmen,
quite well known to history. Some of them bore
names, then distinguished but now forgotten. Most
of them, even at that time, were quite unknown outside
of the immediate districts whence they came. All of
them, twelve years earlier, had been “subjects” in an
empire whose fundamental law was and is that its legislative
government can exercise any power whatever to
interfere with human freedom and can delegate any
<i>such</i> power to other governments in that empire. The
object of the American Revolution was to change that
fundamental law, embodying the Tory concept of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
proper relation of government to human being, into
the basic law of America, embodying the American
concept of that relation declared in the great Statute
of ’76, that no government can have any power <i>of
that kind</i> except by direct grant from its own citizens.
During that Revolution, human beings in America, in
conformity with their respective beliefs in the Tory or
the American concept of the relation of human being
to government, had been divided into what history
knows as the Tories and the Americans. Many of the
human beings, assembled in those conventions of ten
or twelve years later, had been sincere Tories in the
days of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Yet, if we average Americans pick up any volume
of their recorded debates in those “conventions,” we
cannot scan a few pages anywhere without finding the
clearest recognition, in the minds of all, that the
American concept had become the basic American law,
that the Tory concept had disappeared forever from
America. All of them knew that, so long as the
Statute of ’76 is not repealed and the result of the
Revolution not reversed, no legislatures in America
can exercise any power to interfere with human freedom,
except powers obtained by direct grant from the
human beings over whom they are to be exercised, and
that no legislatures can give to themselves or to another
legislature any <i>such</i> power. It was common
in those “conventions” of long ago to illustrate some
argument by reference to this admitted legal fact and
the difference between the fundamental law of Great
Britain and of America, in these respects. In that
North Carolina convention, the same Iredell, after
pointing out that the American concept of the relation
of citizen to all governments had become basic American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
law, contrasts that fact with the fundamental law
of Great Britain where “Magna Charta itself is no
constitution, but a solemn instrument ascertaining certain
rights of individuals, <i>by the legislature</i> for the
time being; and <i>every</i> article of which the <i>legislature</i>
may at any time alter.” (4 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 148.)</p>

<p>In the Pennsylvania convention, on December I,
1787, one of the most distinguished lawyers of that
generation made a memorable speech, expressing the
universal knowledge that the American concept had
taken forever the place of the Tory concept in fundamental
American law. We commend a careful study
of that speech to those of our public leaders and “constitutional”
lawyers, who for five years have been
acting on the assumption that the Tory concept has
again become our fundamental American law. We
average Americans, after living with those earlier
Americans, are not surprised to listen to the statements
of Wilson. “The secret is now disclosed, and it is
discovered to be a dread, that the boasted <i>state sovereignties</i>
will, under this system, be disrobed of part
of their power.... <i>Upon what principle is it
contended that the sovereign power resides in the
state governments?</i>... The proposed system
sets out with a declaration that its existence depends
upon the supreme authority of the people alone....
When the principle is once settled that <i>the people</i> are
the source of authority, the consequence is, that they
may take from the <i>subordinate</i> governments powers
which they have hitherto trusted them, and place those
powers in the general government, if it is thought that
there they will be productive of more good. They
can distribute one portion of power to the more contracted
circle, <i>called state governments</i>; they can also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
furnish another proportion to the government of the
United States. Who will undertake to say, as a state
officer, that the people may not give to the general
government what powers, and for what purposes, they
please? How comes it, sir, that these state governments
dictate to their superiors—to the majesty of the
people?” (2 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 443.)</p>

<p>We average Americans, legally bound (as American
citizens) by no command (interfering with our
human freedom) except from our <i>only</i> legislature at
Washington and then only in those matters in which
<i>we ourselves</i>, the citizens of America, have directly
given it power to command us, now intend insistently
to ask all our governments, the supreme one at Washington
and the subordinate ones in the states of which
we are also citizens, exactly the same question which
Wilson asked.</p>

<p>Daniel Webster asked almost exactly the same question
of Hayne and history does not record any answer
deemed satisfactory by the American people. Webster
believed implicitly in the concept of American law
stated by those who made our Constitution. Like
them, and unlike <i>our</i> “constitutional” lawyers, he knew
that the Tory concept of the relation of men to their
government had disappeared from American basic law.</p>

<p>“This leads us to inquire into the origin of this
government, and the source of its power. Whose agent
is it? Is it the creature of the state legislatures, or
the creature of the people?... It is, sir, the
people’s constitution, the people’s government—made
for the people, made by the people, and answerable to
the people. The people of the United States have
declared that this Constitution shall be the supreme
law. We must either admit the proposition, or dispute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
their authority. The states are, unquestionably, sovereign,
so far as their sovereignty is not affected by
this supreme law. But the state legislatures, as political
bodies, however sovereign, are yet not sovereign
over the people.... The national government
possesses those powers which it can be shown <i>the people</i>
have conferred on it, <i>and no more</i>.... We
are here to administer a Constitution emanating immediately
from the people, and trusted by them to our
administration.... This government, sir, is the
independent offspring of the popular will. It is not
the creature of state legislatures; nay, more, if the
whole truth must be told, the people brought it into
existence, established it, and have hitherto supported
it, for the very purpose, amongst others, of imposing
certain salutary restraints on state sovereignties....
The people, then, sir, erected this government.
They gave it a constitution, and in that constitution
<i>they</i> have enumerated the powers which <i>they</i>
bestow upon it.... Sir, the very chief end,
the main design for which the whole constitution was
framed and adopted, was to establish a government
that should not be obliged to act through state agency,
depend on state opinion and state discretion....
If anything be found in the <i>national</i> constitution,
either by original provisions, or subsequent interpretation,
which ought not to be in it, the people know how
to get rid of it. If any construction be established,
unacceptable to them, so as to become practically a
part of the constitution, <i>they</i> will amend it at their
own sovereign pleasure. But while the <i>people</i> choose
to maintain it as it is—while <i>they</i> are satisfied with it,
and refuse to change it—<i>who</i> has given, or who <i>can</i>
give, to the state legislatures a right to alter it, either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
by interference, construction, <span class="allsmcap">OR OTHERWISE</span>?...
Sir, the people have not trusted <i>their</i> safety, in regard
to the general constitution, to these hands. They have
required other security, and taken other bonds.” (From
Webster’s reply to Hayne, U. S. Senate, January, 1830.
4 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 498 et seq.)</p>

<p>We average Americans, now educated in the experience
of the average American from 1776 to the beginning
of 1787, find much merit and comfort in
Webster’s understanding of basic American law. He
had a reasoned and firm conviction that Americans
really <i>are</i> citizens and not subjects. His conviction,
in that respect, while opposed to the convictions of <i>our</i>
leaders and “constitutional” lawyers, has seemed to
us quite in accord with the convictions of earlier leaders
such as Iredell and Wilson and the others, and also
with the decisions of our Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, it has become quite clear to us that
the American people, from 1776 to 1787, were fixed
in their determination <i>to make</i> our basic American
law what the conviction of Webster and the leaders
of every generation prior to our own knew it to be.
Let us go back, therefore, to the Americans in the
Philadelphia convention of 1787, who worded the
Constitution which is the supreme law of America,
and ascertain how their knowledge of fundamental
American law dictated the wording of their proposed
Seventh Article.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br><span class="small">PHILADELPHIA ANSWERS “CONVENTIONS, NOT
LEGISLATURES”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>We recall how clearly the Americans at Philadelphia,
in 1787, knew that any grant of <i>national</i>
power to interfere with the freedom of individuals
<i>was</i> the constitution of government. We recall the
bitter conflict of opinion, threatening the destruction
of the assembly, over the manner of choosing the members
of the legislature to exercise whatever powers
<i>of that kind</i> the citizens of America might grant. We
recall the great opposition to the proposal of a grant
of <i>any</i> power <i>of that kind</i> and to the particular proposal
of each of the enumerated powers <i>of that kind</i>,
all embodied in the First Article.</p>

<p>We have thus come to know with certainty that the
minds of the Americans at Philadelphia, during those
strenuous four months, were concentrated mainly upon
a proposal to grant some <i>national</i> power to interfere
with the human freedom of all Americans. In other
words, we have <i>their</i> knowledge that their proposed
First Article, by reason of its grants of <i>such</i> power,
would constitute a new nation and government of men,
if those grants were validly made by those competent
to make <i>such</i> grants.</p>

<p>Under which circumstances, we realize that it became
necessary for them to make a great legal decision,
in the construction of basic American law, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
<i>before</i> making that decision, which was compelled to
be the result of judgment and not of will, accurately to
ascertain one important legal fact. Indeed, their decision
was to be the actual conclusion reached in the
effort to ascertain that legal fact. This was the single
question to which they must find the right answer:
“Under our basic American law, can legislatures ever
give to government any power to interfere with the
human freedom of men, or must every government in
America obtain its only valid powers <i>of that kind</i> by
direct grant from its own citizens?”</p>

<p>It is easy for us to state that they should have
known that the answer to that question was expressly
and authoritatively given in the Statute of ’76. It was
there plainly enacted that every just power of any government
must be derived from the direct grant of those
to be governed by its exercise. Yet our own leaders
for the last five years have not even asked the question,
much less known the right answer.</p>

<p>At Philadelphia, in 1787, they <i>did</i> know it. They
had no doubt whatever about it. We shall see that
quickly in our brief review of the record they made at
Philadelphia in ascertaining and deciding, as a legal
necessity, to whom their First Article and its enumerated
grants of <i>national</i> power must be sent and, when
we boast of how quickly we knew the answer, we
should admit that we did not know it until <i>after</i> we had
lived again with them through their experience of the
preceding ten or twelve years which had educated
them, as it has just educated us, to that knowledge.
Furthermore, many of us average Americans will be
unable to explain, until later herein, why, during the
last five years, our own leaders have not known the
right answer. The Statute of ’76 has not been wholly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
unknown to them. The record of the Philadelphia
Convention and the ratifying conventions has not been
entirely a closed book to them. The important and
authentic statements of Webster and other leaders of
past generations have been read by many of them. If
they did not understand and know the correct answer,
as we now realize they have <i>not</i> known, let us not withhold
from the Americans at Philadelphia our just
tribute of gratitude that they <i>did</i> accurately know,
when it was amazingly important to us that they should
know.</p>

<p>When <i>those</i> Americans came to answer that question,
there were facts which might have misled them
as other similar facts of lesser importance have undoubtedly
misled our leaders.</p>

<p>In 1776, from that same Philadelphia had gone a
suggestion that a constitution of government, with Articles
granting power to government, be made in each
former colony. In 1787, there had gone from that
same Philadelphia a proposal that a constitution of a
general government for America be made, with Articles
granting power to that government. The
proposal of 1776 had suggested that the proposed
Articles be made by the people themselves, assembled
in conventions. The proposal of 1777 had suggested
that the proposed Articles be made by the legislative
governments of the states. Both proposals, even as
to the makers of the respective Articles, had been acted
upon. All the Articles, although some had been made
by the people themselves and others by legislatures,
had been generally recognized as valid law. Some of
the men at Philadelphia in 1787 had been members of
the proposing Second Continental Congress, when the
respective proposals of 1776 and 1777 had gone from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
Philadelphia. When, in 1787, they were called upon
to find and state, as their legal decision, the correct
answer to their important question, it was necessary
for them to ascertain, as between state “legislatures”
and the people themselves, in “conventions,” <i>which</i>
could validly make the Articles which had been worded
and were about to be proposed. It would not, therefore,
have been beyond the pale of our own experience
if the earlier proposals had misled them and they had
made the wrong answer to the question which confronted
them. Furthermore, as we have already
noted, although we can little realize the influence of
such a fact upon men seeking the correct legal answer
to an important question, their whole proposal was a
new adventure for men on an uncharted sea of self-government.
Under all of which circumstances, let us
again pay them their deserved tribute that they went
unerringly to the only correct answer.</p>

<p>We know that the essence of that answer is expressed
in the Seventh Article proposed from Philadelphia.
Only one answer was possible to Americans
of that generation. They had been “subjects” and had
become “citizens.” They knew the vital distinctions
between the two relations to government.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Convention which framed the Constitution was,
indeed, elected by the state legislatures. But the instrument,
when it came from their hands, was a mere proposal,
without obligation, or pretensions to it. It was reported
to the then existing Congress of the United States,
with the request that it might “be submitted to a convention
of delegates, chosen <i>in</i> each state by the <i>people</i>
thereof, under the recommendation of its legislature, for
their assent and ratification.” This mode of proceeding
was adopted; and by the Convention, by Congress, and
by the state legislatures, the instrument was submitted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
the people. They acted upon it in the only manner in
which they can act safely, <i>effectively</i>, and wisely, on such
a subject, by assembling in convention. It is true, they
assembled in their several states; and where else should
they have assembled? No political dreamer was ever wild
enough to think of breaking down the lines which separate
the states, and of compounding the <i>American</i> people into
one common mass. Of consequence, when they [the <i>American</i>
people] act, they act <i>in</i> their states. But the measures
<i>they</i> adopt do not, on that account, cease to be the measures
of the people themselves, or become the measures of
the state governments. From these conventions the Constitution
[<i>the First Article grants of power to interfere
with individual freedom</i>] derives its whole authority. The
government proceeds directly from the people; is “ordained
and established” in the name of the people....
It required not the affirmance, and could not be negatived,
by the state governments.... To the formation of a
league, such as was the Confederation, the state sovereignties
were certainly competent.</p>
</div>

<p>But, when a general government of America was to
be given any national power to interfere with the individual
freedom of its citizens, as in the First Article
of 1787 and in the Eighteenth Amendment of 1917,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0">acting directly on the people, the necessity of referring
it to the people, and of deriving its powers directly from
them, was felt and acknowledged by all. The government
of the Union, then, (whatever may be the influence of
this fact on the case,) is, emphatically, and truly, a government
of the people. In form and <i>in substance</i> it emanates
from them. <i>Its powers are granted by them</i>, and are
to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit.
(Marshall in the Supreme Court, M’Culloch v. Maryland,
4 <i>Wheat.</i> 316.)</p>
</div>

<p>Marshall was one of the Americans who had been
at Valley Forge in 1778, and at other places whose
sacrifices <i>made</i> it the basic law of America that all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
power over American citizens <i>must</i> be derived by
direct grant from themselves. Later, he was prominent
in the Virginia convention where all Americans in
Virginia knew and acted upon this basic law. These
facts qualified him to testify, from the Bench of the
Supreme Court, that <i>all</i> Americans <i>then</i> knew and
acknowledged the binding command of that basic law.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, it was impossible that the
Americans at Philadelphia should not have known and
obeyed that law in the drafting of their proposed
Seventh <i>and Fifth</i> Articles. Both of these Articles,
the Seventh wholly, and the Fifth partly, deal with the
<i>then</i> future grant of national power over the people and
its only <i>legal</i> gift by direct grant from the people themselves,
assembled in their “conventions.” Both Articles
name the people of America, by the one word
“conventions.”</p>

<p>That Philadelphia should not have strayed from the
legal road clearly marked by the Statute of ’76 was
certain when we recall how large a part Madison
played at Philadelphia, and particularly how he personally
worded and introduced, in the closing hours
at Philadelphia, what we know as its Fifth Article.
As to his personal knowledge of this basic law, we
recall his letter of April, 1787, where he said, “To give
the new system its proper energy, it will be desirable
to have it ratified by the authority of the people, and
not merely by that of the legislatures.” And we recall
his later words, when urging Americans to adopt the
Constitution with its Fifth and Seventh Articles, he
said of the Seventh, “This Article speaks for itself.
The express authority of the people <i>alone</i> could give
due validity to the Constitution,” to its grants of power
over the people in its First Article. (<i>Fed.</i> No. 43.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>That we may fix firmly in our own minds the knowledge
which all Americans <i>then</i> had, which <i>our</i> leaders
never acquired or have entirely forgotten, let us
briefly review what the earlier Americans did at Philadelphia
in obedience to that knowledge of basic American
law.</p>

<p>On May 28, Randolph of Virginia “opened the
main business” of the Convention. He proposed fifteen
resolutions embodying the suggestion of what
should be in the different Articles. Resolution Number
15 was that such Articles should be submitted to
“<i>conventions</i>,” “to be expressly chosen by the people,
to consider and decide thereon.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 128.)</p>

<p>The first short debate on this Resolution took place
on June 5. In it Madison stated that he “thought this
provision <i>essential</i>. The Articles of Confederation
themselves were defective in this respect, resting, in
many of the states, on the <i>legislative</i> sanction only.”
The resolution was then postponed for further consideration.
On June 12, “The question was taken on
the 15th Resolution, to wit, referring the new system
to the people of the United States for ratification. It
passed in the affirmative.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 183.) This
was all in the Committee of the Whole.</p>

<p>On June 13, that Committee made their full report,
in which the Randolph Resolution Number 15 was embodied
in words as Resolution Number 19 of the
report. On June 16, while the Convention was again
sitting as a Committee of the Whole, the great struggle
was on between the conflicting opinions as to how and
in what proportion should be elected the future legislators
who were to exercise the granted powers over
Americans. On that day, the discussion centered on
the relative merits of the Randolph <i>national</i> proposals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
and a set of <i>federal</i> Articles amending the existing
Federal Constitution. In supporting Randolph, Wilson
of Pennsylvania stated that “he did not fear that
the people would not follow us into a <i>national</i> government;
and it will be a further recommendation of Mr.
Randolph’s plan that it is to be submitted to <i>them</i>, and
not to the <i>legislatures</i>, for ratification.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i>
196.)</p>

<p>On July 23, Resolution Number 19 came up for
action. Remembering how insistent many of the delegates
were that the <i>general</i> government should be kept
a purely <i>federal</i> one, it is not surprising to find Oliver
Ellsworth of Connecticut opening the short debate
with a motion that the Constitution “be referred to
the legislatures of the states for ratification.” But it
will also be remembered that the powers to be granted
in the new Articles had not yet been settled. The
<i>nationalists</i> in the Convention, intent on having some
<i>national</i> Articles, knew that the proposed ratification
must be by the people themselves, “felt and acknowledged
by all” to be the only competent grantors of
<i>national</i> powers.</p>

<p>Colonel Mason of Virginia “considered a reference
of the plan to the authority of the people as one of
the most important and essential of the resolutions.
<i>The legislatures have no power to ratify it.</i> They are
the mere creatures of the state constitutions, and
cannot be greater than their creators.... Whither,
then, must we resort? To the people, with whom all
power remains that has not been given up in the constitutions
derived from them. It was of great moment
that this doctrine should be cherished, as the basis of
free government.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 352.)</p>

<p>Rufus King of Massachusetts, influenced undoubtedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
by the error of thinking that the Convention
meant to act within the Articles of Confederation, was
inclined to agree with Ellsworth “that the legislatures
had a competent authority, the acquiescence of the
people of America in the Confederation being equivalent
to a formal ratification by the people.... At
the same time, he preferred a reference to the
authority of the people, expressly delegated to conventions,
as the most certain means of obviating all
disputes and doubts concerning the legitimacy of the
new Constitution.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 355.)</p>

<p>Madison “thought it clear that the legislatures were
incompetent to the proposed changes. These changes
would make essential inroads on the state constitutions;
and it would be a novel and dangerous doctrine,
that a legislature could change the constitution under
which it held its existence.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 355.)</p>

<p>Ellsworth’s motion to send to the state legislative
governments, and not to the people themselves, assembled
in “conventions,” was lost by a vote of seven to
three. Resolution Number 19, that the new Articles
must be sent to the people themselves was adopted by
a vote of nine to one, Ellsworth and King both voting
for it. (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 356.)</p>

<p>This impressive discussion, now continued for over
a month of 1787, with its display of accurate knowledge
of the distinction between sending Articles to
legislatures and “<i>referring</i>” them to the people, makes
quite amusing what we shall hear later in 1917. It
will come from the counsel of the political organization
which dictated that governments should make the supposed
Eighteenth Amendment. After he kindly tells
us that history has proven that these Americans of
1787 “builded more wisely than they knew,” meaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
“than he knew,” he shall later impart to us the remarkable
information that “the framers in the Constitutional
Convention knew very little, if anything,
about referendums.”</p>

<p>The Resolutions, which had now become twenty-three
in number, on July 26, were referred to the Committee
of Detail to prepare Articles in conformity
therewith. On August 6, that Committee made its
report of twenty-three worded Articles. In Article
XXII was embodied the requirement that the Constitution
should be submitted “to a <i>convention</i> chosen
in each state, under the recommendation of its legislature,
in order to receive the ratification of such
<i>convention</i>.” This provision, the Philadelphia answer
and always the only legal answer to the question as
to who can validly grant power to interfere with
individual freedom, was later seen not properly to
belong in the Constitution itself. For which reason,
it was taken out of the Constitution and embodied in
a separate Resolution which went with the Constitution
from Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In Article XXI, the first draft of our Article VII,
it was provided: “The ratification of the <i>conventions</i>
of —— states shall be sufficient for organizing this
Constitution.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 381.)</p>

<p>The month of August was passed in the great debates
on the proposed grants of national power and
the other proposed Articles. When the Convention
was drawing to a close on August 30, Articles XXI and
XXII were reached.</p>

<p>Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania “moved to
strike out of Article XXI the words, ‘<i>conventions</i> of
the,’ after ‘ratification,’ leaving the states to pursue
their own modes of ratification.” Rufus King “thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
that striking out ‘<i>conventions</i>,’ as the requisite mode,
was equivalent to giving up the business altogether.”
Madison pointed out that, “The people were, in fact,
the fountain of all power.” The motion of Morris
was beaten. An attempt was made to fill the blank in
Article XXI with the word “thirteen.” “All the states
were ‘No’ except Maryland.” The blank was then
filled by the word “nine” the vote being eight to three.
The two articles were then passed, the vote thereon
being ten to one. (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 499-502.)</p>

<p>On September 10, the beginning of the last business
week of the Convention, Gerry of Massachusetts
moved to reconsider these two Articles. The short
discussion was not in connection with any matter in
which we are now interested. His motion was lost.
The entire set of worded Articles was then referred to
a committee for revising the style and arrangement of
the Articles agreed upon. (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 535.)</p>

<p>On Wednesday, September 12, that Committee reported
our Constitution, with its seven Articles, as we
know them except for some slight changes made during
the discussions of the last three or four days of the
Convention. In these seven Articles, the language of
the earlier Article XXII did not appear. As it really
was the statement of the correct legal conclusion of the
Convention that its proposed Articles, <i>because</i> they
would grant power to interfere with individual freedom,
<i>must</i> necessarily be made by the people themselves,
its proper place was outside the Constitution
itself and in a special Resolution of the same nature
as every Congress resolution proposing an amendment
to that Constitution. That was the view of the Committee
and, on Thursday, September 13, the Committee
reported such special Resolutions, in the very words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
of the former Article XXII. “The proceedings on
these Resolutions are not given by Mr. Madison, nor
in the Journal of the Federal Convention. In the
Journal of Congress, September 28, 1787, Volume 4,
p. 781, they are stated to have been presented to that
body, as having passed in the Convention on September
17 immediately after the signing of the Constitution.”
(5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 602.)</p>

<p>This is the Resolution:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Resolved</span>, That the preceding Constitution be laid
before the United States in Congress assembled; and
that it is the opinion of this Convention, that it should
afterwards be submitted to a convention of delegates
chosen in each state by the people thereof, under the
recommendation of its legislature, for their assent and
ratification; and that each convention, assenting to and
ratifying the same, should give notice thereof to the
United States in Congress assembled.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Resolved</span>, That it is the opinion of this Convention,
that, as soon as the conventions of nine states
shall have ratified this Constitution, the United States
in Congress assembled should fix a day, etc.” (5 <i>Ell.
Deb.</i> 541.)</p>

<p>This Resolution is the most authoritative statement
of the legal conclusion reached by these leaders of a
people <i>then</i> “better acquainted with the science of government
than any other people in the world.” The
conclusion <i>itself</i> was compelled by accurate knowledge
that the government of “citizens” can validly obtain
only from the citizens themselves, by their direct grant,
any power to interfere with their individual freedom.
The expression of that knowledge, in the Resolution,
is, in many respects, one of the most important recorded
legal decisions ever made in America. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
average Americans, educated with those Americans at
Philadelphia through their experience of the years
between 1775 and 1787, cannot misunderstand the
meaning and importance of that decision. Instructed
by our review of their actions and their reasoning at
Philadelphia in reaching that conclusion and making
that legal decision, we know, with an accurate certainty,
that it was their declaration to the world and to
us that no proposal from Philadelphia suggested that
Americans again resume the relation of “subjects” to
any government or governments.</p>

<p>Our minds impressed with this accurate knowledge
that such was not their purpose, we now prepare to
complete our education as American citizens, not subjects,
by reading the Philadelphia story and language
of their Fifth Article, their only other Article which
even <i>partly</i> concerned the future grant of new government
power to interfere with individual American
freedom. By reason of <i>our</i> education, we will then
come to the reading of the language of this Article,
as the Americans read it and understood it when they
made it in their “conventions” that followed the proposing
convention of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Being educated “citizens” and not “subjects,” we
ourselves will no longer, as <i>our</i> leaders have done for
five years, mistake the only correct and legal answer to
the indignant outburst of Madison, who wrote this
Fifth Article at Philadelphia. “Was, then, the American
Revolution effected, was the American Confederacy
formed, was the precious blood of thousands spilt,
and the hard-earned substance of millions lavished, not
that the people of America should enjoy peace, liberty,
and safety, but that the governments of the individual
states, that particular municipal establishments, might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
enjoy a certain extent of power, and be arrayed with
certain dignities and attributes of sovereignty? We
have heard of the impious doctrine in the Old World,
that the people were made for kings, not kings for
the people. Is the same doctrine to be revived in the
New, in another shape—that the solid happiness of
the people is to be sacrificed to the views of political
institutions of a different form?” (<i>Fed.</i> No. 45.)</p>

<p>The American answer, from the people of America
assembled in the conventions that ratified that Fifth
Article, was a clear and emphatic “No.” The Tory
answer of the last five years, from <i>our</i> leaders and our
governments, has been an insistent “Yes.”</p>

<p>No one, however, with any considerable degree of
truthfulness, can assert that there has come from the
American people themselves, during the last five years,
any very audible “Yes.” To whatever extent individual
opinions may differ as to the wisdom or legality
of the new constitution of government of men, made
entirely by governments, no unbiased observer has
failed to note one striking fact. By a very extensive
number of Americans otherwise law-abiding, Americans
in all classes of society, the new government edict,
the government command to “subjects,” has been
greeted with a respect and obedience strikingly similar
to the respect and obedience with which an earlier generation
of Americans received the Stamp Act and the
other government edicts between 1765 and 1776.</p>

<p>When the Americans of that earlier generation were
denounced by the government which had issued those
edicts to its “subjects,” one of the latter, five years before
Americans ceased to be “subjects” of that government,
stated: “Is it a time for us to sleep when our
free government is essentially changed, and a new one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
is forming upon a quite different system—a government
without the least dependence upon the people?”</p>

<p>It may be but a coincidence that, while our American
government was announcing its recognition of the
wide-spread American disrespect for the new government
edict, it is only a few days since throughout
America there resounded many eulogies of the Samuel
Adams, who made that statement in the Boston <i>Gazette</i>
of October 7, 1771. In those eulogies, there was
paid to him the tribute that he largely helped to bring
about the amazing result of American desire for individual
freedom which culminated in the assembling of
the Americans in the “conventions” which ratified the
proposed Constitution.</p>

<p>We have already sensed that the existence of the
supposed Eighteenth Amendment depends entirely
upon an amazing modern meaning <i>put into</i> the Fifth
Article made in those conventions. Let <i>us</i>, therefore,
who are Americans now educated in the experience of
the Americans who assembled in those “conventions,”
sit therein with them and there read the story and the
language of the Fifth Article as they read it when they
made it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br><span class="small">THE FIFTH ARTICLE NAMES ONLY “CONVENTIONS”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It has been the misfortune of our prominent Americans
of this generation that they read the Fifth
Article with <i>preconceived</i> notions of its meaning. To
the error of that method of reading it, we average
Americans will not pay the tribute of imitation. We
know that its meaning to those who made it in the
“conventions” of the earlier century is the meaning
which it must have as part of the supreme law of the
land. That we may read it as they read it and get its
clear and only possible meaning, as they got it, we shall
briefly review the story of its wording and its proposal
at Philadelphia. That Convention immediately preceded
the assembling of the people in their own “conventions.”
In each of their “<i>conventions</i>,” among the
people assembled, were some who had been prominent
at Philadelphia, such as Madison and Randolph and
Mason in Virginia, Hamilton in New York, Wilson in
Pennsylvania and the Pinckneys in South Carolina.
Moreover, between the Philadelphia proposal and the
assembling of these conventions, Madison and Hamilton,
proposer and seconder of the Fifth Article <i>at
Philadelphia</i>, had been publishing their famous essays,
now collectively known as <i>The Federalist</i>, in the New
York newspapers to explain the Articles worded at
Philadelphia and to urge their adoption. Under
which circumstances, it is clear that, if we want to read
and know the meaning of the Fifth Article as it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
understood in those conventions, the Fifth Article
which named those same “conventions,” we must complete
our education by an accurate and brief review of
the story of that Article at Philadelphia. Only in that
way shall we average Americans of today be in the
position in which were the Americans who made that
Article.</p>

<p>When we read that story of Philadelphia, in relation
to the Fifth Article, one thing stands out with amazing
clarity and importance. We already know how that
Convention, until its last days, was concentrated upon
the hotly debated question of its own proposed grants
of <i>national</i> powers in the First Article. In the light
of which continued concentration, it is not surprising
to learn that, until almost the very last days, the delegates
forgot entirely to mention, in their tentative Fifth
Article, the existing and limited ability of state legislatures
to make federal or declaratory Articles, and
mentioned only “conventions” of the people, who alone
could or can make <i>national</i> Articles.</p>

<p>The first suggestion of what we now know as the
Fifth Article was on the second day, May 29, when
the Randolph Resolution 13 read “that provision
ought to be made for the amendment of the Articles
of union whensoever it shall seem necessary.” This
wording was the exact language of Resolution 17 of
the report of the Committee of the Whole. It was
adopted by the Convention on July 23. Three days
later, with the other Resolutions, it was referred to
the Committee of Detail “to prepare and report the
Constitution.” On August 6, this Committee, in the
first draft of our Constitution, reported the following:
“Art. XIX. On the Application of the legislatures of
two-thirds of the states in the Union, for an amendment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
of this Constitution, the legislature of the United
States shall call a <i>convention</i> for that purpose.”</p>

<p>We see clearly why the delegates, their minds concentrated
on their own proposed grants of <i>national</i>
powers, mentioned only the people themselves, the
“conventions” of the “Seventh” and “Fifth” Articles,
who alone can make <i>national</i> Articles, and forgot to
mention legislatures, because the latter never can make
national Articles. <i>That</i> kind of Article was the only
thing they were <i>then</i> thinking about. Naturally, it then
escaped their attention that, if they proposed a wise
and proper distribution of <i>national</i> power between the
new American government and the respective existing
state governments, almost every future Article, if not
every one, would be of the <i>federal</i> kind, which legislatures
or governments could validly make, as they
had made all the Articles of the existing federation.
Clearly <i>for that reason</i> this Article XIX never
even mentioned the existing and limited ability of
legislatures.</p>

<p>Between this report of August 6 and August 30, the
Convention was again entirely occupied with the grants
of <i>national</i> power and the election of the legislators to
exercise it or, in other words, with what is now the
First Article. On August 30, Article XIX was adopted
without any debate.</p>

<p>We are now aware that the Convention was within
two weeks of its end and no one had mentioned, in
what is now the Fifth Article, the state governments
or legislatures as possible makers of <i>federal</i> Articles,
if and when <i>such</i> Articles were to be made in the
future.</p>

<p>It was not until September 10, Monday of the last
Convention week, that Article XIX again came up for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
action, when Gerry of Massachusetts moved to reconsider
it. His purpose, as he himself stated it, was to
object because it made it possible that, if the people in
two-thirds of the states called a convention, a majority
of the American people assembled in that convention
“can bind the Union with innovations that may subordinate
the state constitutions altogether.” Hamilton
stated that he could see “no greater evil, in subjecting
the people in America to the major voice than the
people of any particular state.” He went on to say that
he did think the Article should be changed so as to
provide a more desirable “mode for <i>introducing</i>
amendments,” namely, drafting and proposing them to
those who could make them. In this respect he said:
“The mode proposed was not adequate. The state
legislatures will not apply for alterations, but with a
view to increase their own powers. The national legislature
will be the first to perceive, and will be most
sensible to, the necessity of amendments; and ought
also to be empowered, whenever two-thirds of each
branch should concur, to call a convention. There
could be no danger in giving this power, as the <i>people</i>
would finally <i>decide</i> in the case.” (5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 531.)</p>

<p>Roger Sherman of Connecticut then tried to have
the Article provide that the national government might
also propose amendments to the several states, as such;
such amendment to be binding if consented to by the
several states, namely, all the states. For reasons that
will appear in a moment, this clear attempt to enable
the states, mere political entities, and their legislatures,
always governments, to do what they might wish with
the individual freedom of the American citizen—thus
making him their subject—was never voted upon. It
was, however, seconded by Gerry of Massachusetts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Its probable appeal to Sherman, always a strong opponent
of the <i>national</i> government of individuals instead
of the <i>federal</i> government of states, was that it
would make it difficult to take away any power from
Connecticut, unless Connecticut wished to give it up.
Its appeal to Gerry, consistently a Tory in his mental
attitude to the relation of government and human being,
was undoubtedly the fact that it would permit
government or governments to do what they might
wish with individual freedom. It does not escape the
attention of the average American that <i>our</i> governments
and leaders, during the last five years, have not
only displayed the mental attitude of Gerry but have
also acted as if the proposal, which he urged, <i>had</i> been
put into what is our Fifth Article. Only on that theory
can we average Americans, with <i>our</i> education, understand
why governments in America have undertaken
to exercise and to vest in our government a <i>national</i>
power over us, which power neither is enumerated in
the First Article nor was ever granted by the citizens of
America to their <i>only</i> government; nor can we understand
why our leaders have assumed that governments
<i>in</i> America, which are not even the government of the
American citizens, can do either or both of these
things. We know, if governments and leaders do not,
that neither thing can ever be possible in a land where
men are “citizens” and not “subjects.”</p>

</div>


<p>Living through the days of that Convention, we
have now seen three months and ten days of its
sincere and able effort to word a Constitution which
would “<i>secure</i> the Blessings of Liberty” to the individual
American. We have seen them spend most of
their time in the patriotic endeavor to adjust and settle
how much, if any, <i>national</i> power to interfere with
individual freedom that Constitution shall give to its
only donee, the new and general government. In
other words, we have seen the mind and thought and
will of that Convention almost entirely concentrated,
for those three months and ten days, upon the Article
which <i>is</i> the constitution of government, the First Article,
with its enumerated grants of general power to
interfere with the human rights of the American
citizen.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind the object of that intense concentration,
the First Article grants of power <i>of that kind</i>,
we average Americans note, <i>with determined intent
never to forget</i>, the effect of that concentration upon
the wording of our Fifth Article up to that tenth day
of September. We note, <i>with determined intent never
to forget</i>, that, from May 30 to September 10, the <i>only</i>
maker of future changes mentioned was the “people”
of America, the most important reservee of the Tenth
Amendment, the “conventions” of the American people
named in both the Seventh and the Fifth Articles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>As this fact <i>and its tremendous meaning</i> have never
been known or mentioned in the sorry tale of the five
years from 1917 to 1922, we average Americans are
determined to dwell upon it briefly so that we cannot
escape an accurate appreciation of the short remaining
story of the one week at Philadelphia, in 1787, in relation
to our Fifth Article.</p>

<p>Only a week earlier, <i>because</i> the First Article did
grant enumerated powers to interfere with individual
rights, the Convention had known that the seven articles
must go to the people directly to say <i>their</i> “Yes”
or “No” to those grants of the First Article. For that
reason the Convention (considering limited legislative
ability to make <i>federal</i> Articles and omnipotent ability
of the “people” to make all Articles) had decided that
it <span class="allsmcap">MUST</span> propose the mode of ratification by the
“people,” the “conventions” of the Seventh and the
Fifth Articles. As Marshall later authoritatively
stated in the Supreme Court, the <i>legal</i> necessity of deriving
national powers from the people themselves,
the “conventions,” was <i>then</i> known and acknowledged
by all.</p>

<p>It was natural, therefore, up to that September 10,
that a convention, concentrated entirely upon grants <i>of
that kind</i>, when wording its Article with a mode of
procedure for making future changes, should have forgotten
any changes except <i>of the kind</i> on which its own
mind was concentrated and should have mentioned in
its amending Article, up to September 10, no maker of
future changes except the people themselves, “conventions”
of the Seventh and the Fifth Articles.</p>

<p>And, at this point, we average Americans note,
<i>again with intent never to forget</i>, that if the one competent
maker of such Articles, the “conventions,” had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
remained the only maker of Articles <i>mentioned</i> in the
Fifth Article, even the great “constitutional” lawyers
of 1920 would never have made the monumental error
of assuming that the Fifth Article was a grant of
power (to those who made it and all the original Constitution)
to make future Articles. Even <i>they</i> would
have noticed and <i>applied</i> to their reading of the Fifth
Article the well known legal fact that grantors never
can and never do grant to themselves what they already
have or a part of it.</p>

<p>Therefore, noting and remembering these significant
facts, we turn with interest to the short story of how
those able Americans at Philadelphia, their minds no
longer exclusively concentrated on their own enumerated
grants, remembered that there was another
maker of Articles with <i>existing</i> but limited ability to
make <i>federal</i> or declaratory Articles. And, with interest,
we shall learn how this last week thought caused
the Convention to change the Fifth Article by adding
a mention of that existing limited ability and prescribing
the mode of its future <i>constitutional</i> exercise.</p>

<p>That we average Americans may never be misled by
inaccurate statements of the short story of how the
mention of that limited ability was added to the mention
of the unlimited ability of the “people” or
“conventions” of the Fifth Article, it is fitting that the
full record of the story be given verbatim. It adds not
a little to our amusement that the story is copied from
the brief of the leading “constitutional” lawyer of
1920 who championed the validity of the Eighteenth
Amendment on the remarkable assumption and error,
common to all his associates and his opponents, that
the new mention changed the Fifth Article into a <i>grant</i>
of ability to those legislatures instead of what its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
author, Madison, knew and stated that Article to be,
a “mode of procedure” for the future <i>constitutional</i>
exercise either of that existing limited ability or the
other existing unlimited ability of the “people” or
“conventions” of the Seventh and Fifth Articles. This
is the record of that September 10, as copied from that
brief, beginning immediately after Hamilton had
voiced his opinion that there could be no danger in
letting Congress <i>propose</i> an Amendment “as the
<i>people</i> would finally decide in the case.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Madison remarked on the vagueness of the
terms, ‘call a Convention for the purpose’ as sufficient
reason for reconsidering the Article. How was a Convention
to be formed? by what rule decide? what the

II <i>Farrand</i>, 558, 559.<br>
</p>

<p>No American citizen, now living or in the generations
to come, if he values at all the human liberty
which the entire Constitution was established to secure,
can spend too much time in reading and understanding
that short record. It is the record left by Madison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
himself, even though it be copied from the brief of the
leading “constitutional” lawyer of 1920 who maintained
his whole argument for the Eighteenth Amendment
on the ground that we have been “subjects” of an
omnipotent government, his clients, since the day, June
21, 1788, when that Fifth Article was enacted by the
American people to secure “the Blessings of Liberty
for themselves and their posterity.”</p>

<p>As we shall later find herein, it is the claim of all
who believe the new Amendment to be in our Constitution,
although they have hitherto not understood
their own claim, that the words of the Article, which
appear in that short record, are the words which
changed the American individuals, free men from July
4, 1776, into subjects of an omnipotent government,
composed of the legislative governments of a fractional
part of the states. Moreover, as we shall also
later learn herein, this absurd and amazing claim is
based wholly on the monumental error of assuming,
without the faintest suggestion or proffer of support
for such an assumption, that the new wording of the
Fifth Article, as proposed by Madison on September
10, changed the amending Article into a grant of
ability to make every kind of Article. The monumental
error fails to see that Madison merely added to
the previous mention of the unlimited ability of the
people or “conventions” a similar mention of the existing
limited ability of the state legislative governments
to make <i>federal</i> Articles or Articles which
neither exercise nor grant power to interfere with
human freedom. Moreover, as we shall also learn
later herein, the extraordinary and unfounded assumption
(that the amending Article was changed on
September 10 into a <i>grant</i> of ability to make Articles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
instead of a recognition and mention of two existing
different abilities, one of which had always been mentioned
therein) has been hitherto concurred in by every
one who has challenged the validity of the Eighteenth
Amendment. <i>They</i> have only differed from the supporters
of the new Amendment in contending that the
impossible grant, absurdly imagined to have been made
by the grantors to <i>themselves</i> as well as to state legislatures,
<i>was</i> a <i>grant</i> of limited ability but did not include
the ability to make an amendment such as the
Eighteenth.</p>

<p>When we do come later herein to the briefs and
arguments of the opponents and supporters of the supposed
Eighteenth Amendment, we shall look in vain to
find therein the faintest suggestion of a claim that there
is anything in the record of September 10, 1787, to justify
their extraordinary and unfounded assumption
that the Fifth Article, on that day, was changed so as
to make it a grant of power from the “conventions”
of the people to the “conventions” of the whole American
people and to the state legislatures. On the
contrary, we shall find every opponent of the supposed
new Amendment making easy the way of its supporters
by joining in the common assumption of all and predicating
every argument against the new Amendment on
the same extraordinary assumption that the Fifth Article
<i>is</i> a grant of power to the grantors and to the
state governments. Not once, in any brief or argument
of the most renowned lawyers in America, shall
we find even the faintest knowledge of two facts which
must be so <i>if</i> the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a grant of power to
the two supposed grantees. That each of the two facts
is a patent absurdity will not alter the logic that they
must be facts, <i>if</i> the Fifth Article is a grant to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
two grantees. The first patently absurd fact is that, if
the Fifth Article is a grant, the “conventions” of 1788
granted to <i>themselves</i>, the supposed grantors, exactly
the same omnipotent power to make all Articles, which
the grantors (a supposed grantee) were exercising at
the very moment when they made the Fifth Article.
The second patently absurd fact, if the Fifth Article
is a grant, is that the whole people of America, assembled
in their “conventions,” after eleven years as
free men, voluntarily relinquished that status to become,
as the whole people of America, “subjects” of
the same legislative governments who are one of
the supposed donees of the absurd and imaginary
grant. This remarkable fact follows as the logical
conclusion of the concept that the “conventions”
granted to the “conventions” and to the state governments,
with Congress to determine which shall exercise
it, the very omnipotent power which the people themselves
(the supposed grantors) were then exercising in
their “conventions” and which eleven years before they
had denied to the British Parliament. When we later
realize that none of our modern leaders saw either
absurd fact to be the certain result of the concept that
the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a grant, we average Americans
ought certainly to be convinced that, if we wish to keep
our individual rights in any matter, it is going to be
necessary for us to understand <i>for ourselves</i> how our
Constitution secures those rights to us.</p>

<p>Forewarned of such necessity, we return with renewed
interest to the examination of the record of the
day on which it is assumed that Madison suggested
that the Fifth Article should be changed into a “grant”
and then proposed to the American people, so that they
might voluntarily relinquish their status as free men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
and become “subjects” of a government with omnipotent
ability to legislate in restraint of their individual
freedom “in all matters whatsoever.” It ought not to
detract from our amusement that this remarkable
proposal of such a “grant” (as our modern leaders
see it) was to go to the American people in each state
and there be approved by that people with the knowledge
that the people in that particular state, on the
occasion of a future proposal, might not elect a single
member of the legislative governments who would
exercise that omnipotent power over their every individual
right.</p>

<p>Our amusement is not lessened when we find that
the supposed “grant” was suggested by Madison and
seconded by Hamilton. The Philadelphia Convention
was being held in the America which had just emerged
from an eight year Revolution to establish the doctrine
that no government could be omnipotent in its ability
to interfere with individual freedom. The Convention
itself had devoted three months and ten days, before
the day in question, to bitter dispute about giving even
enumerated powers <i>of that kind</i> to the American government
mentioned in the First Article. It is therefore,
with great amusement <i>but with serious intent
never to forget</i>, that we note that not a single voice
was raised in the Convention either to uphold or to
protest this supposed and absurd “grant” of omnipotence
to an entirely different government. On the
contrary, as we note with intent never to forget, the
newly worded Article was treated by the Convention
as if every <i>important</i> matter in it had been settled before
the state governments were even mentioned in it
as makers of the kind of Articles which they already
had the power to make, <i>federal</i> Articles. As soon as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
the newly worded Article had been suggested by
Madison and Hamilton, the Article which Madison
himself describes as a <i>constitutional</i> mode for the
exercise of existing abilities to make Articles, only one
change (utterly unimportant now) was suggested in
the new wording. This was the suggestion that the
Article should not provide a <i>constitutional</i> mode in
which existing ability to interfere with slavery could
be <i>constitutionally</i> exercised prior to the year 1808.
This change was immediately made by the Convention.
Then, without the slightest objection to any other part
of the supposed absurd “grant,” the Convention approved
the newly worded Article.</p>

<p>From the absence of one word of protest we quite
clearly realize that no man in that Convention so misconstrued
the simple statement of Madison’s Fifth
Article as to read into it an imaginary “grant” of any
ability whatever to the state legislative governments.
We realize that these men, who were accurate thinkers,
knew that the “conventions” named in this Madison
Article were exactly the same “conventions” which
Philadelphia had already named in what we know now
as the Seventh Article. We realize that they knew
at once, when Madison proposed his Article, that the
“conventions” named in it, like the same “conventions”
named in the Seventh, were “We, the people”
of America, named in the Preamble. And, from a
moment’s reflection, we are aware that the delegates
at Philadelphia immediately knew that Madison was
not making the absurd suggestion that the American
people, the “conventions” of the Seventh and Madison’s
new Article, should <i>grant</i>, in the very “conventions”
of the Seventh, to <i>themselves</i>, anything whatever
of power, either all or part of the power which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
they would be then exercising in those “conventions.”
From which it follows, as the night the day, that the
delegates also knew that if Madison’s Article was not
a grant by the “conventions” to the “conventions,” it
was not a grant to the “legislatures.” For which reason
we will not dwell at all upon the obvious fact that
there is not the slightest suggestion of a word of grant
in the Fifth Article.</p>

<p>Before emphasizing the absurdity of the thought
that the Americans at Philadelphia ever intended the
plain statement of the Fifth Article to be a “grant” of
power of any kind, it seems proper that we should
grasp at once what it clearly <i>was</i> understood by them
to be. Their understanding and knowledge of its
meaning become very clear to us, when <i>we</i> read it, as
they heard it from Madison, fresh from their great
debate as to the grant of enumerated powers in their
First Article and their proposal of a ratification by
“conventions” as the only valid mode of ratification
for an Article which grants power to interfere with
human freedom. We recall now that, when Madison
suggested <i>his</i> Fifth Article to them, on September 10,
the echoes were still ringing of the sound statements
of Madison and others that Philadelphia <i>must</i> propose
a mode of ratification by the people or “conventions”
because legislatures never could be competent,
in America, to make Articles which did constitute government
by granting power to interfere with human
freedom. When <i>we</i> read Madison’s Fifth Article,
with the same statements still fresh in <i>our</i> minds, we
realize at once how the delegates at Philadelphia recognized,
in the Madison Article, the meaning of every
reference to the duties imposed upon, not the powers
granted therein, to Congress. The delegates had met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
at Philadelphia with purpose and intent to draft and
<i>propose</i> constitutional Articles in their judgment best
designed to secure human liberty to Americans, and
then, after they had drafted their Articles and knew
the nature of such Articles, whether <i>national</i> or <i>federal</i>,
to <i>propose</i> a mode of ratification in which their
proposed Articles would be made by those competent
to make them.</p>

<p>When September 10 had come they had finished
their work of drafting their Article, which constituted
government, the First Article. For the purpose of
reaching their decision as to the valid mode of ratification
for an Article of <i>that kind</i>, they had considered
and discussed the existing unlimited ability of the “people”
or “conventions” to make all Articles, and the
existing limited ability of the state legislatures to make
some. The unerring decision which they had made
was that their Articles would not be validly made,
because the First Article constituted <i>national</i> government
of men, unless they proposed a mode of ratification
by the “conventions” of the American people.</p>

<p>We note, with intent to remember, that they were
well aware that drafting and proposing an Article did
not make it valid or part of a Constitution and that
<i>proposing</i> a mode of ratification did not make it a
valid mode, unless the ratifiers were competent to make
the proposed Article. We recall that Wilson, who
appears in the brief record of September 10, later
made clear the knowledge of those at Philadelphia
that their <i>proposal</i> of Articles and their <i>proposal</i> of a
mode of ratification could not make either valid, that
the making of a <i>proposal</i> is not the exercise of any
power.</p>

<p>In the Pennsylvania convention he said: “I come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
now to consider the last set of objections that are
offered against this Constitution. It is urged that this
is not such a system as was within the powers of the
Convention; they assumed the <i>power of proposing</i>....
I never heard, before, that to make a proposal
was an exercise of power.... The fact
is, they have exercised no power at all; and, in point
of validity, this Constitution, proposed by them for
the government of the United States, claims no more
than a production of the same nature would claim,
flowing from a private pen.” (2 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 469-470.)</p>

<p>Now, if Wilson and the other delegates at Philadelphia,
on September 10, knew that to make a proposal
was no exercise of power, they clearly understood
that Madison’s Fifth Article, when it stated
that Congress might <i>propose</i> an Amendment and Congress
might <i>propose</i> a mode of ratification, was an
Article which purported to grant no power to Congress.
If we recall the truth, which Madison so often
expressed, that it is the privilege of any citizen or
body of citizens to propose that existing power be
exercised, we realize that, if the Fifth Article had not
mentioned Congress as the maker of either proposal,
Congress would still have had full ability to make
either or both proposals at any time. As the delegates
at Philadelphia knew this as well as we now
know it, as we have been helped to our appreciation
of it by them and their statements, it is apparent how
instantly they knew that the mention of Congress, as
the <i>proposer</i> of an Amendment and as the <i>proposer</i>
of its mode of ratification, meant that Congress <i>alone</i>
was to be left with—<i>not given</i>—the duty which they
had assumed themselves to perform at Philadelphia.
That duty, as they knew and we now know, was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
draft a proposed Article and, after it had been worded,
to examine it and its nature and (with the validity
of their ultimate proposal absolutely determined by
that nature) then to propose the Article and a mode
of ratification for it which would mean ratification by
those competent to ratify an Article of <i>its particular
kind</i>. In other words, they knew that, whenever Congress
performed the duty they had just performed
themselves, after an Article had been drafted, it would
be legally necessary for Congress, as it had been for
them at Philadelphia, to consider the existing and different
abilities of the “people” or “conventions” and
the state legislatures to make Articles, and from that
consideration to ascertain a competent ratifier for the
particular Article they had drafted and, the validity
of the ratification to depend entirely on the accuracy
of their ascertainment and not on their own proposal
of ratification, to propose a mode of ratification in
which that Article would be made by those competent
to make it. With the meaning and effect of a “proposal”
so clearly known to them all, with their own
immediate recent experience in the performance of
the very duty which Madison’s Fifth Article <i>left</i> the
duty of Congress in the future, it was a simple matter
for these delegates at Philadelphia to know exactly
what was the only possible meaning of Madison’s
words, when the same “shall have been ratified by
three fourths at least of the legislatures of the several
states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as
one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed
by the legislature of the U. S.”</p>

<p>How accurately Madison himself knew all this, how
accurately he knew that the Philadelphia proposal
would validate neither proposed Articles nor proposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
mode of ratification, and that Congress proposal in
the future would never validate either proposed Article
or proposed mode of ratification, he has not left
to speculation.</p>

<p>It was the charge of the opponents of the proposed
Constitution that the Philadelphia Convention had
exceeded its powers in proposing those Articles. Madison
defended himself and his Philadelphia associates
in <i>The Federalist</i>, Number 40, published in the New
York <i>Packet</i> on Friday, January 18, 1788. With his
logical mind, he echoed the knowledge of Wilson and
his other colleagues, who had drafted and proposed
the Articles and proposed their ratification by the “people”
or “conventions” of the Seventh and the Fifth
Articles. It was his knowledge, as it was their knowledge,
that the Philadelphia proposals were, as the
future Congress proposals would be, no exercise of
power and that the validity of any Article, proposed at
Philadelphia or proposed by Congress, must always
depend, not <i>merely</i> upon its being ratified in the mode
proposed respectively by Philadelphia or by Congress,
but also—and immeasurably the most important test
of valid ratification—upon its being ratified by ratifiers
competent to make the particular Article.</p>

<p>It was his knowledge, as it was their knowledge, as
it is now our knowledge, that if a proposed Article
directly interfere with or grant power to interfere with
human freedom, as the First Article, or the Eighteenth
Amendment, it can never be validly made by government
but only by the “people” of the Tenth Amendment;
the “conventions” of the “Seventh” and “Fifth”
Articles.</p>

<p>Among other things, in his defense of himself and
his Philadelphia associates, this is what Madison said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
of them: “They must have reflected, that in all great
changes of established governments, forms ought to
give way to substance; that a rigid adherence in such
cases to the former would render nominal and nugatory
the transcendent and precious right of the <i>people</i>
to ‘abolish or alter <i>their</i> governments as to <i>them</i> shall
seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness,’
since it is impossible for the people spontaneously and
universally to move in concert towards their object;
and it is therefore essential that such changes be instituted
by some <i>informal and unauthorized propositions</i>
made by some patriotic and respectable citizen or number
of citizens. They must have recollected that it
was by this irregular and assumed privilege of <i>proposing</i>
to the <i>people</i> plans for <i>their</i> safety and happiness
that the states were first united against the danger
with which they were threatened by their ancient government;
that committees and congresses were formed
for concentrating their efforts and defending their
rights; and that <i>conventions</i> were <i>elected</i> in <i>the several
states</i> for establishing the constitutions under which
they are now governed;... They must have
borne in mind that as the plan to be framed and proposed
was to be submitted <i>to the people themselves</i>,
the disapprobation of the supreme authority would
destroy it forever; its approbation blot out antecedent
errors and irregularities.”</p>

<p>And so we come from that September 10, 1787, with
the accurate knowledge that Madison then proposed
and Hamilton seconded and all the delegates adopted
the first amending Article which ever <i>mentioned</i> the
state governments as makers of any future Amendments.
And we know that they did so with the unmistakable
intent and understanding that it changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
not at all the existing inability of any governments in
America to create, for themselves or for other governments,
any <i>national</i> power to interfere with the
citizens of America in the exercise of their human
freedom. And we also come from that record with
the certain knowledge that the Madison Fifth Article
of September 10 merely provided that, when future
Articles were suggested, the Congress should play the
part which the Philadelphia Convention was playing,
which part involved no exercise of power of any kind,
and that such part of Congress should consist in merely
<i>proposing</i> an Article and <i>proposing</i> its mode of ratification.
And we also come from that day with the
equally certain knowledge, which we do not intend to
forget, that Madison himself knew clearly that the
valid ratification of future Articles <i>would</i> depend, as
he knew the valid ratification of the Philadelphia Articles
<i>did</i> depend, not on the fact that ratification was in
the mode proposed but on the fact that the proposer
of a mode of ratification should propose a mode in
which the proposed Article could be made by those
competent to make an Article <i>of its particular kind</i>.</p>

<p>For these reasons, if the supporters of the Eighteenth
Amendment expect us, now educated with those
earlier Americans up to and including the record of
September 10, 1787, to believe that the Madison Fifth
Article, first worded on that day, purported to grant
or was understood and intended by Madison and his
colleagues to grant any power to the state legislative
governments <i>in</i> America over ourselves, the citizens
of America, we shall hereafter listen, with naught but
amusement, to these amateur “constitutional” thinkers
and their effort to change legal fact into fiction by
assumption. Confirmed by our education with Madison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
and the others who had all to do with the wording
and the making of that Fifth Article of September 10,
1787, we recognize, even if these “constitutional”
thinkers do not recognize, that we ourselves are the
“conventions” of the Fifth Article in which sit the
American people to exercise their exclusive ability to
grant to government any power to interfere with their
individual freedom. We have now, even if these “constitutional”
thinkers never have had, the knowledge
of the legal necessity that power <i>of that kind</i> must be
derived from ourselves, the “people” of the Tenth
Amendment and the “conventions” of the Seventh and
the Fifth Articles—the necessity in 1787 “felt and
acknowledged by all.” We know, as Marshall knew
in one of those “conventions” of 1788 and as he knew
and stated on the Bench of the Supreme Court, that
there is but one way in which we, the citizens of
America, can act safely or <i>effectively</i> or wisely on the
subject of new interference with our individual freedom,
by assembling in our “conventions,” the “conventions”
of the Fifth as well as the Seventh Article.</p>

<p>And so, with our knowledge and certainty that the
Madison Fifth Article of September 10 never could
change the status of the free American into that of
the subject of an omnipotent government, we come to
the last business day of the Philadelphia Convention,
September 15, the only other day on which the Madison
Fifth Article, with its <i>mention</i> of legislative ability
to make <i>federal</i> Articles but not <i>national</i> Articles,
was ever considered at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>On that day the Committee of Style reported the
seven Articles which we now know as our Constitution.
The Madison amending Article, except that “the legislature
of the U. S.” was called “the Congress,” was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
identical with that of September 10. As it is important
that we Americans shall never be told anything about
the record of September 10 or September 15, in relation
to this Madison Fifth Article, which is not something
that <i>is</i> in the record, that we may be given no
distorted version of what happened in that Convention
about the only Article which ever mentioned state
“legislatures” as makers of <i>some</i> future Articles, we
shall have again the pleasure of reading the entire
record of September 15. Again we read it from the
brief of the great “constitutional” lawyer of 1920 who
argued on the assumption that this Article, worded by
Madison, was intended to make us and did make us,
the citizens of America, the subjects of an omnipotent
government, composed mostly of the client governments
whom he represented in the Court Room of
1920. This is his record of the full story of September
15 in relation to the Fifth Article of Madison, from
which record this “constitutional” lawyer and his associates
hope to derive—how we know not—some support
for this belief and this argument.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sherman expressed his fears that three fourths
of the States might be brought to do things fatal to
particular States, as abolishing them altogether or
depriving them of their equality in the Senate. He
thought it reasonable that the proviso in favor of the
States importing slaves should be extended so as to
provide that no State should be affected in its internal
police, or deprived of its equality in the Senate.</p>

<p>“Col. Mason thought the plan of amending the
Constitution exceptionable and dangerous. As the
proposing of amendments is in both the modes to
depend, in the first immediately, and in the second,
ultimately, on Congress, no amendments of the proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
kind would ever be obtained by the people, if the government
should become oppressive, as he verily believed
would be the case.</p>

<p>“Mr. Govr. Morris &amp; Mr. Gerry moved to amend
the article so as to require a Convention on application
of two thirds of the Sts.</p>

<p>“Mr. Madison did not see why Congress would
not be as much bound to propose amendments applied
for by two thirds of the States as to call a Convention
on the like application. He saw no objection however
against providing for a Convention for the purpose
of amendments, except only that difficulties might arise
as to the form, the quorum etc. which in Constitutional
regulations ought to be as much as possible avoided.</p>

<p>“The motion of Mr. Govr. Morris and Mr. Gerry
was agreed to nem: con (see: the first part of the
article as finally past)</p>

<p>“Mr. Sherman moved to strike out of art. V. after
‘legislatures’ the words ‘of three fourths’ and so after
the word ‘Conventions’ leaving future Conventions to
act in this matter, like the present Conventions according
to circumstances.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sherman moved according to his idea above

</p>

<p>At once we notice with interest that these men, renowned
as the marvelous leaders of a people better
acquainted with the science of government than any
other people in the world, men who have spent three
entire months and fifteen days in their wonderful effort
to frame a constitution which will secure “the Blessings
of Liberty” to all American individuals and their
posterity, still have no knowledge whatever, the weird
and marvelous knowledge of 1917 and 1920, that this
Madison Fifth Article gives to the state governments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
the very omnipotence which the American people, by
a successful Revolution, had just wrested from the
British Parliament. We note with interest Mason’s
objection to the Madison “mode of procedure” in
which may thereafter be exercised the limited ability
of these very state governments to make <i>federal</i> Articles
and the unlimited ability of the people or conventions
to make <i>national</i> Articles. Mason’s objection,
having direct reference to the grant of <i>national</i> powers
in the First Article and his fear (the continued and
expressed fear for the next two years in the “conventions”
of the Seventh and the Fifth Articles) that the
people may find these <i>enumerated</i> powers oppressive,
is that, if the people <i>do</i> find them oppressive, Congress,
which has these powers, will never <i>propose</i> an Amendment
to take any of these powers away from Congress.
For which reason Morris and Gerry moved to amend
the Article so that, if Congress does not propose an
Amendment for which there seems to be a demand,
the legislatures of two thirds of the states may insist
that Congress call a convention and that such convention
may <i>propose</i> an Amendment. This suggestion
was carried.</p>

<p>We next find Sherman moving to strike out the
words “three fourths” after the word “legislatures”
and after the word “conventions.” This motion was
defeated. We next find, <i>and we fix firmly in our mind
with intent never to forget</i>, that Gerry moved to strike
out of Madison’s Article all reference to the “people”
of the Preamble and the Tenth Amendment, the “conventions”
of the Seventh and the Fifth Article, as the
makers of any future Articles or changes in the Constitution.
His motion was “to strike out the words
‘<i>or by conventions in three fourths thereof</i>.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>As <i>almost</i> every one, during the last five years, including
the sponsor of the Eighteenth Amendment in
the House of Representatives, seems to have had an
edition of our Constitution, in which the Fifth Article
does not contain these words, and as <i>everyone</i>, during
the same five years, has argued and acted as if these
words were not in the Fifth Article or have no meaning
whatever of the slightest importance, we intend
to note <i>and never forget</i> that Gerry’s motion to strike
these words out was beaten by a vote of ten to one.</p>

<p>As we know, the “people” of America <i>themselves</i>
are identified by the word “conventions” in this Fifth
Article, just as they are identified by the same word
in the Seventh Article. As we know, <i>we ourselves</i>—the
posterity of the “people” of the Preamble—are
identified by this word “conventions” in the Fifth Article,
just as we are identified in the Tenth Amendment
as the most important reservee thereof by the word
“people.” Wherefore our interest in this motion of
Gerry and its overwhelming defeat is only exceeded
by our absolute amazement, for the last five years, at
the universal ignorance of the fact that it <i>was</i> defeated
and of the fact that <i>we</i> are mentioned in the
Fifth Article as the only competent makers of any
new Articles which either directly interfere or grant
power to interfere with our individual freedom.</p>

<p>We do not know, and to an extent we do not care,
what was the purpose of Gerry. Gerry was always
an opponent of a Constitution which vested <i>national</i>
power in a general government. He was an advocate
of the continued complete independence of each state
and its government and of a mere <i>federal</i> union of
states with a purely <i>federal</i> constitution. He was also
always a consistent Tory in his mental attitude as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
the relation of human being to government. If he had
been successful in striking out any mention of ourselves,
the “people” or “conventions,” leaving only
the mention of the state legislatures, with their existing
ability to make <i>federal</i> Articles, it would have been
impossible that any further <i>national</i> power (beyond
the grants of the First Article) be vested in the general
government or taken from each state government,
as only we ourselves could make <i>national</i> Articles
like the First. We surmise that a mixture of his
Tory mental attitude and his opposition to a general
national government (which minimized the importance
and diminished the independent sovereignty of each
state government) prompted his motion. That his
motion was overwhelmingly defeated is the only important
fact for us American citizens. We shall not
forget it even if our leaders and our “constitutional”
thinkers forget it and ignore it.</p>

<p>We have no further interest in the short record of
that September 15. No other change was made in
the Madison Fifth Article except to take out of it any
<i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure for the exercise of
the existing ability of ourselves, the “people” or “conventions,”
to deprive any state of an equal representation
in the Senate with every other state. We still can
do that, but we have no <i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure
under the Fifth Article by which we can exercise
our ability to do it. This change was not, however,
as so many have absurdly thought, an exception
to an imaginary power which we ourselves, the “conventions”
of the Seventh Article and the “people” of
the Preamble and the Tenth Amendment, in those
very “conventions,” “granted” to ourselves, the same
“people” and “conventions” mentioned in the Fifth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
Article. It was a recognition of our existing ability,
about to be exercised in those “conventions,” the ability
of the supreme will in America to deprive any state
of its equal representation in the Senate; and it was
our own exclusion of that ability from any <i>constitutional</i>
exercise. The reflecting mind will remember
that, in the heated arguments at Philadelphia, there
was strong sentiment in favor of asking us, the people
of America, the “conventions” of the Seventh Article,
to exercise our exclusive ability in that very respect
and make the Senate a body composed of members
elected from larger proportions of the people than
the members of the House of Representatives. It was
the recollection of that effort which prompted the
request that our exclusive ability to do that very thing
should not be provided with a <i>constitutional</i> mode of
future exercise.</p>

<p>We average Americans may now leave, in our present
education, the entire story of that wonderful Convention
at Philadelphia. We leave it with a knowledge
of our Constitution we never had until we had
lived with those Americans through the actual record
of those three months and seventeen days from the
end of May to September 17, 1787. We bring from
it a knowledge that brooks no contradiction. We are
certain that nothing in any of the Articles proposed
at Philadelphia purported to give the state legislatures
any power of any kind whatever, in the Fifth Article
or anywhere else, either to interfere with the individual
freedom of the American citizen or to grant
the power of such interference to themselves or to our
only government, the Congress. We bring from that
Convention the knowledge that, <i>unless</i> something in
the conventions of the American people, the “conventions”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
of the Seventh Article <i>and the Fifth Article</i>,
changed the free men of America, the citizens of America,
into subjects of an omnipotent legislative government,
we ourselves in 1923 are still the citizens of
America and possessors of the supreme will in America
and are subjects of no government or governments
in the world.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Constitution is a written instrument. As such its
meaning does not alter. That which it meant when adopted
it means now. <i>Being a grant of powers to a government
its language is general.</i>... While the powers
granted do not change, they apply from generation to generation
to all things to which they are in their nature applicable.
This in no manner abridges the fact of its changeless
nature and meaning. Those things which are within
its grant of power, as those grants were understood when
made, are still within them, and those things not within
them remain still excluded. (Justice Brewer, in the Supreme
Court, South Carolina v. United States, 199 <i>U. S.</i>
437, at p. 448.)</p>

<p>It is not only the same in words, but the same in meaning,
and delegates the same powers to the government, and
reserves and secures the same rights and privileges to the
citizen; and as long as it continues to exist in its present
form, it speaks not only in the same words; but with the
same meaning and intent with which it spoke when it came
from the hands of its framers, and was voted on and adopted
by the people of the United States. (Scott v. Sandford, 19
<i>How.</i> 393, p. 426.)</p>
</div>


<p>From which common sense statements of what always
has been both reason and law, we know
that whatever the Fifth Article meant to those who
made it, in the conventions named in it as well as in
the Seventh Article, it means today. There is no
better way in which we can grasp its meaning to the
American people assembled in those conventions, than
by sitting with them and reading it as they read it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
with their fresh knowledge of all the wonderful things
in which they had participated from the Statute of ’76
to the proposal from Philadelphia of 1787. As we
have just lived through all that period with them, we
are in a wonderful position to read it and understand
it as they understood it. Moreover, we are in a wonderful
position to listen to the statements of the men
in those “conventions.” In those statements, whether
by advocates or opponents of the Constitution, we
shall find the invincible negation—without one dissent—of
the absurd <i>assumption</i> that Madison’s Fifth
Article is a “<i>grant</i>” of any ability <i>to make</i> Articles.
In those statements, we shall find all discussion of that
Fifth Article centering upon the one question, i.e.,
whether it provides a practical mode of procedure in
which the exclusive ability of the “people” or “conventions”
can defend individual rights by <i>withdrawal</i>
of some part of the power of interference therewith
granted in the First Article. Mason had pointed out
at Philadelphia that the procedural provisions of the
Fifth Article—<i>and it consists entirely of procedural
provisions for the exercise of existing powers</i>—<i>left</i>
the drafting and proposal of Amendments entirely to
governments. For which reason, in the “conventions,”
Henry and all the great opponents of the Constitution
argued that, if the individual Americans found
the granted <i>national</i> powers of the First Article dangerous
to human liberty, the “people” or “conventions”
would never get the <i>constitutional</i> opportunity
to exercise their ability to withdraw.</p>

<p>“You”—the “you” being the individual Americans
assembled in one convention—“therefore, by a natural
and unavoidable implication, give up your rights to
the general government.... If you give up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
these powers,” the enumerated powers of the First
Article, “without a bill of rights, you will exhibit the
most absurd thing to mankind that ever the world saw—a
government that has abandoned all its powers—the
powers of direct taxation, the sword, and the purse.
You have disposed of them to Congress, without a bill
of rights—without check, limitation, or control. And
still you have checks and guards; still you keep barriers—pointed
where? Pointed against your weakened,
prostrated, enervated state government! You
have a bill of rights to defend you against the state
government, which is bereaved of all power, and yet
you have none against Congress, though in full and
exclusive possession of all power! You arm yourselves
against the weak and defenseless,” the state legislatures
mentioned in the Fifth Article, “and expose
yourselves naked to the armed and powerful. Is not
this a conduct of unexampled absurdity?”</p>

<p>So thundered Henry in the Virginia convention. (3
<i>Ell. Deb.</i> 446.)</p>

<p>“To encourage us to adopt it, they tell us that
there is a plain, easy way of getting amendments.
When I come to contemplate this part, I suppose that
I am mad, or that my countrymen are so. The way
to amendment is, in my conception, shut. Let us consider
this plain, easy way.” Then follows the verbatim
statement of the Madison Fifth Article as proposed
from Philadelphia. “Hence it appears that three
fourths of the states must ultimately agree to any
amendments that may be necessary. Let us consider
the consequence of this. However uncharitable it
may appear, yet I must tell my opinion—that the most
unworthy characters may get into power and prevent
the introduction of amendments. Let us suppose—for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
the case is supposable, possible, and probable—that
you happen to deal those powers to unworthy
hands; will they relinquish powers already in their
possession, or agree to amendments? Two thirds of
the Congress, or of the state legislatures, are necessary
even to propose amendments.... To
suppose that so large a number as three fourths of
the states will concur is to suppose that they will possess
genius, intelligence, and integrity, approaching to
miraculous. It would indeed be miraculous that they
should concur in the same amendments, or even in
such as would bear some likeness to one another; for
four of the smallest states, that do not collectively
contain one tenth part of the population of the United
States, may obstruct the most salutary and necessary
amendments. Nay, in these four states, six tenths of
the <i>people</i> may reject these amendments....
So that we may fairly and justly conclude that one
twentieth part of the <i>American people</i> may prevent
the removal of the most grievous inconveniences and
oppression, by refusing to accede to amendments. A
trifling minority may reject the most salutary amendments.
Is this an easy mode of securing the public
liberty? It is, sir, a most fearful situation, when the
most contemptible minority can prevent the alteration
of the most oppressive government; for it may, in
many respects, prove to be such.” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 48.)</p>

<p>So thundered Henry against the weakness of the
Madison procedure in which only by proposal from
governments could there be <i>constitutionally</i> evoked the
<i>exclusive</i> ability of the citizens of America to dictate
how much power to interfere with individual freedom
should be left for the citizens of each state to use in
governing themselves, and how much power <i>of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
kind</i> should be retained by the individual people of
America themselves. Henry was opposing a Constitution
in which the individual people of America were
dictating that their general government, the Congress,
should have only the enumerated powers of that kind
which are in the First Article. In it, they were dictating
that each state government, except as the American
people forbade it, should have just so much <i>of
that kind of power</i> as the citizens of that particular
state should grant that government. And in it, they
were dictating that the people of America themselves,
the most important factor and reservee of the Tenth
Amendment, should retain all other power <i>of that
kind</i> to be granted only by themselves, the “conventions”
of the Madison Fifth Article. Throughout
all his thunder against that Constitution, Henry, like
every other opponent of that Constitution, never questioned
that this was the exact distribution of power
to interfere with individual freedom which <i>was</i> dictated
in the Constitution. His only complaint, and
their only complaint, was that the Madison Fifth Article,
<i>because</i> its constitutional procedure could only be
evoked by a proposal from governments, was no protection
to human liberty against the granted power <i>of
that kind</i> in the First Article. The absurd thought of
our modern “constitutional” thinkers (contradicting
the plain statement of the Tenth Amendment and contradicting
<i>everything</i> that was said in the “conventions”
that made the Fifth Article) is that the Article
itself is a “<i>grant</i>” of omnipotent power to governments
(the legislative governments of the states) to interfere
with individual freedom. When we contrast the
knowledge of Henry and his colleagues with the modern
absurdity, we echo Henry’s words and exclaim,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
“We suppose that we are mad, or that our modern
constitutional thinkers are so.” If Henry had read
into that Fifth Article, if the opponents of the proposed
Constitution had read into it, any “<i>grant</i>” of
ability to state governments, certainly it was an absurdity
for him to refer to those governments as “weakened,
prostrated, enervated” by the proposed Constitution.</p>

<p>And so, educated in the experience of those Americans
who assembled in those “conventions” named in
the Seventh and Fifth Articles, we sit with them in
the conventions of that earlier day and read that Fifth
Article with them, while they decide to make it with
the six other Articles. Living through their experience,
like them we have become “a people better acquainted
with the science of government than any
other people in the world,” so far as government is
intended to secure <i>individual</i> liberty and happiness.
When we sit with them, we intend not to forget, as
they never did forget in those conventions, that this
was the sole purpose of the Constitution they considered
and made, the purpose of securing <i>individual</i>
liberty and happiness. In this respect, they differed in
their whole philosophy of government with the new
school of thought that, in our day, has its different
manifestations of exactly the same philosophy of government
on the part of the Bolshevik in Russia and
the minority in America which has dictated that government
enactment of the new constitution of government,
known as the Eighteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>The Americans of ’76 and ’87 set the individual
liberty and freedom of man above everything in this
world except the Divine Will of the Creator of man.
In the Preamble of their Constitution, they echo the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
declarations of their Statute of ’76. Their creed was
that the laws of right and wrong are immutable; that
the Creator made the individual man and granted
human freedom to him; that such freedom is inherently
subject only to the Divine Will, the immutable
law of right and wrong, but that it may voluntarily
become subject, by the will of the individual man, to
the exercise of powers of interference which only he
and his fellow men themselves can ever validly grant
to government.</p>

<p>“But what is government itself, but the greatest of
all reflections on human nature? If men were angels,
no government would be necessary. If angels were to
govern men, neither external nor internal controls on
government would be necessary. In framing a government
which is to be administered by men over men,
the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable
the government to control the governed; and in the
next place, oblige it to control itself.” (Madison or
Hamilton, <i>Fed.</i> No. 51.)</p>

<p>When we sit in the conventions of 1787 and 1788
with the Americans who had this common concept of
the only purpose of government of men, their concept
is our own as we read with them the language of the
Fifth Article. And it is impossible for us, as it is impossible
for them, to find concealed in that language
the thought of a “grant” to government, a “grant”
which would challenge this concept of the very purpose
of government. They are sitting in “conventions”
assembled to determine whether American individuals
will enter into the new society of men, which
is to be America. They have received the Fifth Article
from Americans in Philadelphia, who have accompanied
the proposal of that Fifth Article with a letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
which states, “Individuals entering into society must
give up a share of liberty, to preserve the rest.” This
statement is recognized by the Americans, in the “conventions”
where we sit, as the exact statement of the
concept of the sole purpose of a government of men.
With that concept and that letter before us, how can
we or the Americans with whom we sit find in the
Fifth Article the remarkable idea that Americans, entering
the society of America, are to give up all their
liberties to the state governments in order that Americans
may preserve the rest of their liberties?</p>

<p>In these modern days, however, there has asserted
itself, in Bolshevik Russia and in the America of which
we are the citizens, two distinct manifestations of an
entirely different concept of the purpose of government
than was the concept of the Americans in the “conventions.”
Although the manifestation of the new
concept by the Bolshevik in Russia has been different
from the manifestation of the new concept by an aggressive
and organized minority in America, the new
concept, at the bottom of each manifestation, is exactly
the same. It is the concept that the purpose of
constituting a government of men is to secure the welfare
of the state or community or nation and not the
liberty and happiness of the individuals who compose
the nation. This is the exact concept of the Bolshevik
Russian and the Eighteenth Amendment American.
To neither of them would the words of that letter
from Philadelphia convey the slightest meaning, the
words “individuals entering into society must give up
a share of liberty, to preserve the rest.” In their
mutual concept, the individual has no liberty which
government need respect. In the Bible of their concept,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
men cannot find the words which declare the
basic American principle, that every just power of
government must come from the individuals who are
to be governed by its exercise. It is, however, a misnomer
to call this common concept of the Bolshevik
Russian and the Eighteenth Amendment American a
<i>new</i> concept. It is identical with the old concept known
as “Socialism,” the concept that community welfare,
the prosperity and power and strength of a nation, are
more important things than individual liberty and happiness
and enjoyment of human freedom. It is a concept
which sets the state (a political entity created by
men) and the welfare of the state above what the
Americans of ’76 and ’87 knew and proclaimed to be
superior to all human creations, namely, the individual
man, the noblest creation of the Divine Creator. In
other words, the common concept of the Bolshevik
Russian and the new Amendment American is but the
reaction to the century-old concept whose repudiation
was the main theme of the Declaration of Independence,
the concept that individual men, the creation of
God, are made for kings or governments or political
entities.</p>

<p>To those who hold such a concept there comes no
shock when they are asked to imagine that the
language of the Fifth Article implies a grant of ability
to the state governments to do what those governments
will with the liberties of the citizens of America. But
we are sitting in “conventions” of Americans of a
different type, Americans who, eleven years earlier,
have repudiated forever the concept that men are made
for kings or governments or political entities. And, if
we wish to know what the Americans in these conventions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
think of the concept of the Bolshevik Russian and
the Eighteenth Amendment American, we get our wish
from the man who wrote the language of the Fifth
Article.</p>

<p>“We have heard of the impious doctrine in the Old
World,” the reactionary doctrine of modern Russia
and of our own aggressive minority, manifested in two
different disguises, “that the people were made for
kings, not kings for the people. Is the same doctrine
to be revived in the New, in another shape—that
the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed
to the views of political institutions of a different
form?... As far as the sovereignty of the states
can not be reconciled to the happiness of the people,
the voice of every good citizen must be, Let the former
be sacrificed to the latter. How far the sacrifice is
necessary, has been shown. How far the unsacrificed
residue will be endangered, is the question before
us.”</p>

<p>This is the language of Madison, in <i>The Federalist</i>,
Number 45, asking the individual Americans to make
the Constitution to secure their individual happiness.
It will amaze us later herein to hear the thought of
our modern “constitutional” thinkers that his Fifth
Article makes the state governments (from whom that
Constitution took sovereignty to secure the individual
happiness of the American citizen) a supreme and
omnipotent government of the American citizens, a
government knowing no will but its own. Meanwhile
let us forget this latter day nonsense and breathe again
the real American atmosphere, where individuals, entering
a society, give up a share of their liberty, to
preserve the rest. Let us sit with the real “constitutional”
thinkers of America as they sat in the conventions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
and read with them the Fifth Article worded by
Madison. This is what they read:</p>

first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first
Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be
deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.</p>
</div>

<p>Sitting with these Americans, in <i>their</i> “conventions,”
we note immediately, as they note, that the Article
names <i>themselves</i>. And we note, as they note, that it
names themselves, the individual American citizens,
the “people” of the Preamble and the Tenth Amendment,
by exactly the same name, “conventions,” as in
the Seventh Article and as in the Resolution of the
Philadelphia Convention, <i>which proposed the only
valid mode of ratification for the constitution of government
of men in the First Article</i>, the mode which
required ratification by the individual Americans themselves,
the “conventions” of the Seventh and the Fifth
Articles. <i>We</i> cannot help noting it—as we intend
never to forget it—because <i>we</i> are sitting with them,
as the people of America, in the very “conventions”
so named in the Seventh Article.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Having their vital and accurate knowledge of the
difference between <i>federal</i> and <i>national</i> Articles, that
only the latter kind exercises or grants power to interfere
with individual human freedom, we recognize at
once why the state legislatures are also mentioned in the
Fifth Article, although they never can make <i>national</i>
Articles. We know it is because those “legislatures,” as
the Tenth Amendment expressly declares, retain their
existing ability to make <i>federal</i> Articles or Articles
which neither exercise nor grant power to interfere
with individual freedom. And, sitting in those “conventions,”
where Hamilton also sits, we recall his remarkable
prophecy, just made to us in <i>The Federalist</i>,
as we were about to enter the “conventions” with the
other Americans therein. “For my own part, I
acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments
which may, upon mature consideration, be
thought useful, will be applicable to the organization
of the government, <i>not to the mass of its powers</i>.”
(<i>Fed.</i> No. 85.) In that absolutely accurate advance
knowledge of the complete history of constitutional
amendment from 1789 to 1917, we recognize the
motive which prompted Madison <i>and Hamilton</i>, on
September 10, 1787, to add the mention of those legislative
governments to the Fifth Article mention of
the <i>exclusive</i> ability of the people or “conventions” to
make all future Articles which <i>do</i> relate to the “mass
of its powers” to interfere with individual freedom
conferred upon the one government of America. We
understand that these legislative governments are mentioned
in the Fifth Article, which we are now reading
in the “conventions” of old, because those “legislatures”
have an existing ability to make <i>federal</i> Articles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
which relate to other things than the <i>national</i> power of
government to interfere with individual freedom.</p>

<p>Having thus satisfied ourselves, in those conventions,
that we ourselves, the “people” of America, <i>are</i>
mentioned in the Fifth Article as the sole makers of
any future Article which exercises or grants power to
interfere with our individual freedom, we turn with
interest to the procedure which the Article establishes
as the only <i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure in which
that exclusive ability of our own may hereafter be
evoked to exercise and be exercised.</p>

<p>From the language of the Article itself, we know at
once that it is simply the statement of a mode of procedure
in which our own unlimited ability or the limited
ability of the state legislatures, when the occasion
seems to arise for the respective exercise of either
ability, are hereafter to be evoked by some body of
men, playing the part which the Philadelphia Convention
has just played in evoking our own exclusive
ability, the ability of the “people” or “conventions.”</p>

<p>Outside the language of the Fifth Article itself,
many other things make that fact clear to us. For instance,
we recall what Madison has just told us. He
had written this Article at Philadelphia. Then, asking
the American people to prescribe this <i>constitutional</i>
mode of procedure for the future exercise of either
respective existing ability, he has explained to us, just
before the convention in which we sit, what the Fifth
Article means.</p>

<p>“That useful alterations will be suggested by experience,
could not but be foreseen. It was requisite,
therefore, that <span class="allsmcap">A MODE FOR INTRODUCING THEM</span>
should be provided. The mode preferred by the Convention
seems to be stamped with every mark of propriety.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
It guards equally against that extreme facility,
which would render the Constitution too mutable;
and that extreme difficulty, which might perpetuate
its discovered faults. It, moreover, equally enables
the general and State governments <span class="allsmcap">TO ORIGINATE</span> the
amendment of errors, as they may be pointed out by
the experience on one side, or on the other.” (<i>Fed.</i>
No. 43.).</p>

<p>Sitting in the conventions of more than a century
ago, we are naturally uninfluenced (in our reading of
plain English) by the story of a century which has not
even yet begun, the century that later began in 1800.
And so we get from his own words the knowledge that
the author of the Fifth Article knew it to be nothing
but a <i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure, for the future
exercise of either ability to make Articles. We see
that the mode <i>leaves</i> with either “the general and state
governments” the ability to <i>propose</i> an Amendment to
those with existing power to make the particular proposed
Amendment. And we note, with intent to remember,
that the author of the Fifth Article, while he
tells us about this reservation of existing abilities to
<i>propose</i> amendments, pointedly does <i>not</i> tell us that the
Article <i>grants</i> any power to any government or governments
to <i>make</i> Amendments. In other words, we
know that the Fifth Article <i>reserves</i> to the general
government and to the state governments exclusively
what <i>otherwise</i> they and every one else would have
had—what Madison himself called “the unauthorized
privilege of any respectable citizen or body of citizens”—the
ability <i>to propose</i>, but that it does not <i>grant</i> to
any of those governments or all of them collectively
the ability which none of them ever had or can have,
the ability <i>to make</i>, constitutional Articles of a <i>national</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
kind, which relate to interference with individual freedom.
With this knowledge confirmed by the clear
statement of the author of the Fifth Article, we read
with interest its procedural provisions about the originating
of new Articles, about their drafting and their
proposal and the proposal of a mode of ratification
for them, after they have been drafted and their nature
has determined who can make them.</p>

<p>Sitting in those conventions of old, we are in the
company of many of the men who were at the Philadelphia
Convention. In Virginia we see Madison and
Randolph and Mason and others; in New York we see
Hamilton and others; in Pennsylvania we see Wilson
and others; in South Carolina we see the Pinckneys
and others. That is our experience in all the conventions.
On all sides, among the American people
assembled therein, are those familiar with and talking
about the work at Philadelphia and the great debate
there, in which was <i>ascertained</i>, from the character of
the Articles drafted there, <i>which</i> maker of Articles,
the state legislatures, with their existing ability to make
federal Articles, or the “people” themselves, the “conventions,”
with their existing unlimited ability to make
all Articles, could make the Articles drafted and about
to be proposed. These men, by their presence and
their words, remind us how the nature of their First
Article, the fact that it constituted government to interfere
with human freedom, compelled the announcement
of the decision that legislative governments could
never make <i>that</i> kind of an Article. These men, by
their presence and their words, remind us how they
reached the ascertainment of the fact which <i>compelled</i>
their Proposing Resolution <i>to propose</i> a mode of ratification
by the “people” themselves, by the “conventions”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
of the Seventh and the Fifth Articles. They
remind us, as one of the men with us later said in the
Supreme Court, that all assembled in our “conventions”
feel and acknowledge the legal necessity that
every power to interfere with individual freedom must
be derived by direct grant from the people. And,
sitting in those conventions with them, where we all
read the Fifth Article they are asked to make, we
recognize <i>with certainty</i> that it prescribes that the
Congress shall do exactly what the Philadelphia Convention
has just done—propose, and nothing more.</p>

<p>The words of the Fifth Article tell us that only
Congress shall draft and propose a new Article, just as
the Philadelphia Convention drafted and proposed its
new Articles; that, after Congress has drafted its new
Article and is about to propose it, just as the Philadelphia
Convention did, <i>when it exercised no power at
all</i>, Congress shall examine carefully the nature of the
drafted Article and, having ascertained by such examination
<i>which</i> existing ability to make Articles (the
limited ability of legislative governments or the unlimited
ability of the “people” or “conventions”) is competent
to make that particular Article, Congress shall
propose ratification by the ability which can make the
proposed Article.</p>

<p>We are not misled because the Article prescribes
this one <i>constitutional</i> mode to evoke the existing limited
ability or the existing unlimited ability. Providing
a <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode for the exercise of either
does not lessen one ability or increase the other. By
reason of our education, we know the difference between
the <i>revolutionary</i> exercise of existing power and
the <i>constitutional</i> exercise of existing power. Because
we have become of the “people better acquainted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
the science of government than any other people in the
world,” we know that to do something in a revolutionary
manner does not necessarily mean to do it by
bloodshed or on the battle-field. We know that to do
something in a revolutionary manner means to do it
outside of any legally prescribed mode of procedure
for the exercise of existing power. We know that to
do the same thing, in a <i>constitutional</i> mode, is to do it
in some mode prescribed by human law or constitution.
And that is why we understand, as did the men with
whom we are sitting in those conventions, that Congress,
in the future, is to do exactly what the Philadelphia
Convention did <i>and nothing more</i>. Congress
is to do it <i>constitutionally</i> (where the Philadelphia
Convention did it outside of any human law and in a
<i>revolutionary</i> manner) <i>because</i> the Fifth Article commands
that Congress alone shall do it. Congress,
when doing it, will be exercising no power. The Philadelphia
Convention exercised no power when it did
exactly the same things. And, when Congress does
it, Congress will be bound, as Philadelphia was bound,
to ascertain and propose the mode of ratification by
which the proposed Article will be ratified by ratifiers
competent to make that particular kind of an Article.</p>

<p>As we sit in the “conventions” and keep clearly in
our mind that the “conventions” and the “state legislatures”
(both of which are mentioned in the Fifth
Article) each have existing but very different abilities
to make Articles, every part of the language of the
Fifth Article confirms our knowledge that the whole
Article is no “grant” of power but is a “constitutional”
mode for the exercise of existing powers.</p>

<p>Long after the conventions in which we sit, the
Supreme Court paid the tribute to those who wrote the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
Fifth Article that they were “masters of apt, precise
and classic English.” Keeping this thought in mind,
our attention is directed to the three-time use of the
one word “propose” in the Fifth Article. We know
that to use the same word three times in one sentence
is very poor English <i>unless</i> there is a distinct and
definite intent and purpose that the meaning each time
shall be <i>identically</i> the same. Such definite intent and
purpose is the only deduction from what would otherwise
be the inexcusable tautology of the language of
the Fifth Article. So, when we read that Congress
“shall <i>propose</i> amendments” or shall “call a convention
for <i>proposing</i> Amendments” and that “one or the
other mode of ratification may be <i>proposed</i> by the
Congress,” we know with certainty that each use of the
word “propose” is intended to convey an identical
shade of meaning. From which we know that, as the
<i>proposal</i> of a new Article (by Congress or a Convention)
will be a mere proposal and will not make the
proposed Article valid, so also the Congress <i>proposal</i>
of a mode of ratification will remain a mere proposal
and will not make that proposed mode valid for that
proposed Article, unless its proposed ratifiers are competent
to make that particular kind of an Article.
This is what they had just known at Philadelphia
about their own proposals (both of Articles and of
mode of ratification) to us as we sit in the “conventions.”
And so, in these conventions, we know the
proposals mentioned in the Fifth Article to be identical
(in nature) with the proposals made from Philadelphia.
We know the procedure outlined in the Fifth
Article to be exactly the same procedure as has just
been followed at Philadelphia. We know that our
ratification (in these “conventions”) of that procedure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
will be our approval of the procedure they followed
at Philadelphia and will be its prescription as the
<span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> procedure hereafter to be followed
when either existing ability, that of the state governments
or that of ourselves in “conventions,” is to be
hereafter evoked to exercise. From all of which we
recognize that, if Congress should propose a mode of
ratification by state legislatures and the proposed Article
is a grant of power to interfere with the individual
liberty of the American citizen, the state legislatures
will remain just as incompetent to make that Article
as they were known to be at Philadelphia when Madison
and his colleagues held them to be incompetent
to make their proposed Article of that kind, the First
Article. And so we understand that the mere Congress
proposal of a mode of ratification (for <i>such</i> an Article)
by state governments will not give state governments
ability to make such an Article.</p>

<p>Sitting in those old conventions, we now have read
the procedural provisions of the Fifth Article up to
the point where proposals bring, in a <i>constitutional</i>
manner, a proposed new Article to makers with existing
ability to make the particular Article which has
come to them.</p>

<p>We now read with interest the next chronological
step of the procedural provisions, the mention of the
two existing makers of Articles—the state legislatures,
makers of federal or declaratory Articles, and the
“conventions” of the American citizens, makers of any
Article.</p>

<p>We are actually sitting in “conventions” identical
with those named in the Fifth Article. We are in
the “conventions” mentioned in the Seventh Article
and named therein by exactly the same word as is used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
in the Fifth Article, the word “conventions.” Both
Seventh and Fifth Articles have been worded at Philadelphia.
We, assembled in the “conventions” named
in the Seventh Article, are the whole American people.
In our conventions, so assembled, we are to make both
the Seventh and the Fifth Articles, with their common
use of exactly the same word “conventions.” And so
we understand, with a knowledge which nothing can
disturb, that the “conventions” of the Fifth Article
mean exactly what the “conventions” of the Seventh
Article mean. Thus we know, with knowledge which
nothing can disturb, that the “conventions,” named in
both Articles, are the American people, only competent
makers (in 1787 or at any future time) of <i>national</i>
Articles which interfere with or grant power to interfere
with the individual freedom of the American
citizen.</p>

<p>We recall vividly the proposal that came from
Philadelphia eleven years earlier or in 1776, that the
Americans in each former colony constitute a government
with such powers to interfere with the human
freedom of its citizens. We recall that such governments
were constituted in what Marshall states to be
the only way in which men can act safely, effectively
or wisely, when constituting government of themselves,
namely, by assembling in “conventions.”</p>

<p>We also recall vividly the proposal that came from
the same Philadelphia a year later or in 1777, that the
states constitute a federal government of states. And
we recall that the state legislatures, because they possessed
existing ability to make <i>federal</i> Articles, did
validly make the <i>federal</i> Articles suggested in that
proposal.</p>

<p>We also recall, that the new Constitution, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
before us in the “conventions” named in the Seventh
Article, is to be both a <i>national</i> Constitution, constituting
government of men, and a <i>federal</i> Constitution,
constituting government of states. And we recall that
only one of the present Articles in that proposed Constitution,
the First Article, constitutes government of
men by granting government power to interfere with
individual freedom. And we recall, with Hamilton
in the Convention beside us, the probability that all
future Articles in that dual Constitution, will probably
be of the <i>federal</i> or the declaratory kind which the
existing ability of state legislatures can make.</p>

<p>And so we understand why Madison and Hamilton,
in their Fifth Article, mention that existing ability of
the state legislatures to make Articles which do not
relate to interference with individual freedom, as well
as they mention our own exclusive ability, the ability
of the “conventions” of the American people, to make
Articles which do relate to interference with individual
freedom.</p>

<p>And, sitting in those conventions with the “people
better acquainted with the science of government than
any other people in the world,” when we read the
language of the Fifth Article, it is impossible for us
to make the monumental error of assuming that the
mention of the two existing abilities adds anything to
one or subtracts anything from the other.</p>

<p>And so, with our minds in those “conventions” free
from any possibility of such monumental error, we
now read and clearly understand the most important
words in the <i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure for existing
powers, which we know as the Fifth Article. To
none of the Americans in those conventions is there
any doubt, to no American, who understands what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
America is, can there ever be any doubt, what <i>are</i> the
most important words. They are the words “in three
fourths thereof” immediately following the words
which name the very kind of “conventions” in which
we sit. These words, “by conventions in three fourths
thereof,” bring home to us the marvel of what our
“conventions” are doing.</p>

<p>In them sit the people of America, possessors of the
supreme will in America, assembled in their respective
states, as free men and not as the citizens of the particular
state in which each convention of Americans
assembles.</p>

<p>We realize, as the Preamble of the Constitution before
us expressly declares, what is the first proposal
upon which we act affirmatively, when we say “Yes”
to the whole proposal from Philadelphia. The first
effect of that “Yes” is that we, that part of the American
people in that particular state, do consent (with
the Americans in eight or more other willing states)
to join the new nation or political society of men, which
is to be America, and that we consent to be, with those
other Americans, the citizens of the new nation as soon
as the Americans in eight other willing states give their
similar “Yes.” We are well aware, as we sit in one
of the “conventions,” that the Philadelphia proposal
has left it open for the free Americans in each state to
become members or not of the new society as they
please, and that, therefore, the joining of that society,
by the Americans in at least nine states, will mean that
the new nation is created by unanimous action of the
majority in every state whose Americans become citizens
of America.</p>

<p>From which we realize that the original grants of
national power by <i>its</i> citizens to the only government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
of the new nation will be the second effect of the “Yes”
from the Americans in nine conventions. Thus these
original grants, the First Article grants of enumerated
power to interfere with the individual freedom of the
American citizen, will be made simultaneously by the
majority of Americans in <i>every</i> state where Americans
become citizens.</p>

<p>But, once these early Americans leave those first
“conventions,” the whole American people will constitute
the members or citizens of the new nation,
America.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The people of these United States constitute one nation.
They have a government in which all of them are deeply
interested. (Justice Miller in the Supreme Court, Crandall
v. Nevada, 6 <i>Wall.</i> 35.)</p>
</div>

<p>As in any other republican nation, all <i>national</i>
powers must be granted by its members or citizens.
Any future <i>national</i> power, not granted by the citizens
themselves, will be neither just nor valid because power
of the American government to interfere with the freedom
of the American citizen will not have been granted
by those to be governed by its exercise.</p>

<p>But, when the whole American people leave these
“conventions” as the united citizens of America, although
it will be wise and proper and necessary that
American citizens shall hereafter assemble in “conventions”
in their respective states for the making of new
proposed grants of power to interfere with their freedom,
it will no longer be necessary that a “Yes” from
<i>every</i> “convention” should be given to any future grant
of <i>such</i> power. When the whole American people assembled
in those first conventions, a “Yes” from every
“convention” <i>was</i> necessary because that “Yes” meant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
the willingness of the Americans in that state to become
citizens of America. But, once they all have
become <i>its</i> citizens, it is in that capacity—and not as
citizens of each respective state—that the American
government will interfere with their individual freedom.</p>

<p>And it now dawns upon us, probably for the first
time, how imperative it is that the new Constitution
should contain an explicit command, prescribing how
the vote of each “convention” should count and how
many “convention” votes should be sufficient and necessary
for any future proposed grant of power to interfere
with the freedom of American citizens. This
brings home to us the impressive and important meaning
of the words “in three fourths thereof” after the
word “conventions” in the Fifth Article.</p>

<p>If they had not been written therein by the genius of
the men at Philadelphia, the method of counting the
vote of each “convention” and the number of “convention”
votes <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONALLY</span> requisite hereafter for
a new grant of <i>national</i> power would be a matter of infinite
dispute. And so we recognize and pay our tribute,
as we sit in one convention of the first American citizens,
to the wonderful foresight of Madison and Hamilton
and their colleagues at the Philadelphia Convention
which has just completed its labors. That tribute
is evoked by the words “three fourths thereof” after
the word “conventions.”</p>

<p>We see that these words end all possibility of dispute
in two important respects where dispute would
be certain if the <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode of procedure
did not contain <i>our</i> command that, when future “conventions”
are asked for further grant of power to interfere
with our individual freedom, the “Yes” of each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
convention shall count as one “Yes” and a “Yes” from
three fourths of the “conventions” shall be both necessary
and sufficient to make a new grant of <i>such</i> power.
And, as we dwell upon these amazingly important
words, their presence in the Fifth Article compels a
greater tribute to the men who wrote them than that
demanded by the fact that this ends the possibility of
the disputes we have mentioned. It grows upon us that
these words are among the most important securities
to individual liberty in the whole Constitution. With
increasing admiration for the men at Philadelphia, we
sit in those early “conventions” and recall how much
Madison and his colleagues have just told us in <i>The
Federalist</i> about the danger to individual right from
the tyranny of the citizens of a republic themselves,
whether that tyranny is attempted by a majority or an
aggressive minority of such citizens. We recall <i>The
Federalist</i>, Number 51, and its forceful exposition of
the merits of the proposed Constitution and its remarkable
distribution of powers (powers <i>granted</i> to
the new government in the First Article, powers <i>left</i>
with each state over its own citizens and powers
<i>retained</i> by the American people themselves) as security
for individual rights.</p>

<p>“In the compound republic of America, the power
surrendered by the people is first divided between two
distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to
each subdivided among distinct and separate departments.
Hence arises a double security to the rights of
the people.... It is of great importance in a republic
not only to guard the society against the oppression
of its rulers, but to guard one part of the
society against the injustice of the other part. Different
interests necessarily exist in different classes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
of citizens. If a majority be united by a common interest,
the rights of the minority will be insecure.
There are but two methods of providing against this
evil: The one by creating a will in the community
independent of the majority—that is, of the society
itself; the other, by comprehending in the society so
many separate descriptions of citizens as will render
an unjust combination of a majority of the whole very
improbable, if not impracticable. The first method
prevails in all governments possessing an hereditary or
self-appointed authority. This, at best, is but a precarious
security; because a power independent of the
society may as well espouse the unjust views of the
major, as the rightful interests of the minor party, and
may possibly be turned against both parties. The
<i>second</i> method <i>will</i> be exemplified in the federal republic
of the United States. Whilst all authority in it
will be derived from and dependent on the society, the
society itself will be broken into so many parts, interests,
and classes of citizens, that the rights of individuals,
or of the minority, will be in little danger
from interested combinations of the majority....
Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil
society. It ever has been and ever will be pursued until
it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit. In
a society under the forms of which the stronger faction
can readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may
as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature, where
the weaker individual is not secured against the violence
of the stronger.... In the extended republic
of the United States, and among the great variety of
interests, parties, and sects which it embraces, a
coalition of a majority of the whole society could
seldom take place on any other principles than those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
justice and the general good.... It is no less certain
than it is important, understanding the contrary
opinions which have been entertained, that the larger
the society, provided it lie within a practical sphere,
the more duly capable it will be of self-government.
And, happily for the <i>republican cause</i>, the practicable
sphere may be carried to a very great extent, by a
judicious modification and mixture of the <i>federal
principle</i>.” (<i>Fed.</i> No. 51.)</p>

<p>In those important words of the Fifth Article, “in
three fourths thereof” after the word “conventions,”
we <i>now</i> recognize the judicious mixture of the federal
principle in our own command which controls our
future <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> exercise of our exclusive
ability to create new power to interfere with our individual
freedom.</p>

<p>These words do not challenge or disturb the legal
American necessity that our American government
must get any new power <i>of that kind</i> from us ourselves,
assembled in our “conventions.” <i>But</i>, with a practical
wisdom never exceeded in framing the “constitution”
of a self-governing nation, these words impose an
amazingly effective check upon the existing ability of a
majority or aggressive minority, in the republic which
is America, to interfere with individual rights. These
words do not attempt to destroy or alter that existing
ability of the citizens of the new republic. On the
contrary, these words recognize the existence of that
ability. But, with the wisdom which means so much
security to every individual right in America, these
words make it impossible that such ability can be <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONALLY</span>
exercised unless a majority or an aggressive
and organized minority, when seeking new
government power to interfere with the individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
freedom of the American citizen, obtain a majority
support from the American citizens residing in every
one of three fourths of the state in America.</p>

<p>Leaving (just for a moment) the conventions of the
old days, we of this generation realize with gratitude
the check so provided. We understand now, as we
never understood before, why the organized minority
which demanded that government write the new
Amendment into our Constitution was driven by this
constitutional check to ignore the plain fact that the
new Amendment can never validly be put into the Constitution
(if we still are citizens and not subjects) unless
a “Yes” from the “people” themselves, the “conventions”
of the Fifth Article, is obtained from three
fourths of those “conventions.” We realize that the
organized minority in question must support their
proposition on the concept that Madison and Hamilton,
who introduced and seconded the Fifth Article
at Philadelphia, intended that Article “to create a will
in the community” (which is America) “independent”
of the supreme will of the American people themselves,
intended it to create that anomaly of a superior will
to the supreme will and to make that superior will the
will of the legislative governments of a fraction of the
states. We refer that organized minority to the
quoted words of Madison or Hamilton, referring to
such creation of a will independent of the people themselves:
“This, at best, is but a precarious security, because
a power independent of the society may as well
espouse the unjust views of the major, as the rightful
interests of the minor party, and may possibly be
turned against both parties. The second method [not
the creation of a will independent of the human members
of the society] will be exemplified in the federal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
republic of the United States,” the very Constitution of
which contains the Fifth Article. We average Americans
are now satisfied, beyond dispute, that neither
Madison nor his associates in the early conventions,
to which we will now return, understood or meant that
the Fifth Article would or should create such an independent
will.</p>

<p>Sitting again in the conventions of old, we recall exactly
the same thought expressed by Madison himself
in <i>The Federalist</i>, No. 10, where he says: “When a
majority is included in a faction, the form of popular
government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice
to its ruling passion or interest both the public good
and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public
good and private rights against the danger of such a
faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and
form of popular government, is then the great object
to which our inquiries are directed.... Either the
existence of the same passion or interest in a majority
at the same time must be prevented, or the majority,
having such co-existent passion or interest, must be
rendered, by their number <i>and local situation</i>, unable to
concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression.”
These thoughts, from the worder of the Fifth Article,
sink deep into our minds and hearts as we sit in those
conventions. They come before us with startling
clearness, when we read his words in that Article,
“<i>conventions in three fourths</i> thereof,” and his words
in reference to that Fifth Article mode of procedure,
“In requiring more than a majority, and particularly in
computing the proportion by <i>states</i>, not by <i>citizens</i>, it
departs from the <i>national</i> and advances toward the
<i>federal</i> character.” (<i>Fed</i>. No. 39.)</p>

<p>We realize that his mode of procedure is <i>national</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
in its strict conformity to the Statute of ’76, that all
power over the people must come <i>directly</i> from the
people, but that a judicious mixture of the <i>federal</i> system,
in <i>counting</i> the votes of the people, is the best
check human ingenuity has yet devised to protect individual
rights against a tyrannical majority or an aggressive
minority.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br><span class="small">TWO ARTICLES NAME “CONVENTIONS”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As we sit in those conventions and dwell upon the
wisdom of the <i>practical</i> thought which inspired
those words, “in three fourths thereof” after the word
“conventions,” we know why the people with whom
we sit compelled the tribute that they grasped the
science of government better than any other people in
the world. The one aim of all of them was the happiness
and welfare of the <i>individual</i>. The welfare or
prosperity of the political entities, which we know as
America and the respective states, were of no importance
to these people, except as they contributed to the
welfare of the <i>individual</i>. The prestige and the power
of each and every government in America and of all
governments in America together were of no importance
to these people, except as they contributed to the
welfare of the <i>individual</i>.</p>

<p>And when <i>we</i> sit with them in their conventions,
after living with them through their experience from
1775, we realize (as we have never realized before)
that the Statute of ’76 was enacted, that
the <i>national</i> constitutions of government were made
by the <i>people</i> in each colony, that the sacrifices of
the Revolution were endured for eight years, that
the federation of states was established by states in
1781, that the wisdom and ability and patriotism of
America had just assembled at Philadelphia in 1787<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
and made its proposal which we are considering
in these conventions—<i>all that the welfare of the</i>
<span class="allsmcap">INDIVIDUAL</span> <i>might be secured</i>. We realize that the
wisdom and ability and patriotism of America, at
Philadelphia, had labored for months to ascertain,
by the light of all human experience, in what proportion
(<i>solely to secure the welfare of the individual</i>)
power to interfere with individual freedom ought
to be surrendered at all to governments and retained
by the people, and in what proportion the
quantum of surrendered power should be <i>left</i> with
each state government over its own individuals and
given to the new general government over its individual
citizens. We realize that the wisdom and
ability and patriotism of America, at Philadelphia,
had <i>known</i> that no governments, then or in the future,
if individual welfare was to be secured, could ever
legally determine either proportion or could ever alter
either proportion, when once established by the supreme
will in America, the “people” of the Preamble
and Tenth Amendment, the “conventions” of the Seventh
and Fifth Articles.</p>

<p>And so we, of this later generation, sit in those “conventions”
of the Seventh Article and we read the Fifth
Article, where the same “conventions” are named, and
look with awe upon the practical wisdom which dictated
these words “in three fourths thereof,” after that
mention of those “conventions” of the American
people in the future. We realize now that those words
are among the greatest securities to individual welfare
written into the proposed Constitution by the wisdom
and ability and patriotism of America, at Philadelphia.
In that Constitution, other great securities protect
individual welfare against usurpation from outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
America and against usurpation by government or
governments <i>in</i> America beyond the exercise of the
<i>national</i> powers granted to each government by its own
respective individual citizens. But this particular great
security of individual welfare, the words “in three
fourths thereof,” secures individual welfare against
the unjust oppression of a majority or an aggressive
minority <i>of the Americans themselves unless</i> that majority
or minority secure a majority of the Americans
in <i>each</i> of three fourths of the states to support the
unjust oppression of individual welfare.</p>

<p>And thus, in those conventions, <i>we</i> realize, perhaps
for the first time, that the <i>important</i> statements of the
Seventh and the Fifth Articles are, in substance, identical
statements by the supreme will of the American
people. They are respectively the two statements or
commands of the citizens of America, the new nation,
as to <span class="allsmcap">WHEN</span> the grants of power in the First Article
shall <i>be</i> the grant of the American citizens and as to
<span class="allsmcap">WHEN</span> the grants of any <i>similar</i> power, in the generations
to come, shall <i>be</i> the grants of the American
citizens. In their language, in their purpose and in
their plain command, both statements are exactly alike
in substance. The statement or command of the
American people, in the Seventh Article, is that the
constitution of the government of interference with
individual freedom, the First Article, shall <i>be</i> the Constitution
of the American people <i>when</i> nine of the
“conventions” (named in the Seventh and Fifth Articles)
shall have said “Yes” to that constitution, to the
enumerated grants of <i>national</i> power in the First Article.
The statement or command of the American
people, in the Fifth Article, is that any new <i>proposed</i>
constitution of government of interference with individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
freedom of the American citizen (the supposed
Eighteenth Amendment being the first new constitution
<i>of that kind</i>) shall be the Constitution of the American
people <i>when</i> three fourths of the “conventions” (named
in the Seventh and the Fifth Articles) shall have said
“Yes” to that new proposed constitution.</p>

<p>At this point, we average Americans, sitting with
those amazing Americans in their “conventions,” fix
firmly in our minds, <i>with intent never to forget</i>, the
fact that the “conventions” of the Seventh Article
command are indisputably the American people themselves;
that the “conventions” of the Fifth Article
command are identical (except as to the time in which
the American people assemble) with the “conventions”
of the Seventh Article command; and that, therefore,
the “conventions” of the Fifth Article command are
also the people of America themselves. But the whole
people of America are the “We, the people” of the
Preamble. They are the only reservee of the Ninth
Amendment, “the people” therein. They are the
“most important factor” and reservee of the Tenth
Amendment, “the people” therein. Wherefore, we
grasp clearly why they are mentioned in the Fifth
Article, because they have no government attorney in
fact—as they could not have if we are “citizens of
America”—to surrender what they reserved to themselves
in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.</p>

<p>Sitting in those conventions, we recall the limited
ability of state legislatures, each speaking for its own
state, to make <i>federal</i> Articles, Articles that neither
interfere nor give power to interfere with individual
liberty, the ability that made all the federal Articles
of 1781. And we recall that the Constitution does not
take that ability from the “states respectively” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
<i>their</i> governments but <i>reserves</i> it to the “states respectively”
and their governments, as the Tenth Amendment
expressly declares. And so we understand the
<i>mention</i> of that limited ability in the Fifth Article in
the words “ratified by the legislatures of three fourths
of the several states.” And, educated by the experience
of the amazing Americans with whom we sit, we
realize the meaning of this particular statement or
command of the supreme will, the people of America.
That supreme will is creating a new nation out of its
human possessors. It is destroying forever the complete
independence of the respective states, but leaving
each of the states a political entity with citizens and
much independence. It is incorporating the system of
a <i>federal</i> union of states into the new national system
of a union of all individual Americans, and it is subordinating
the members of the <i>federal</i> union and also
the <i>federation</i> itself to the union of human beings, to
the supreme will in America, the will of the citizens of
that nation. Therefore, as each state is no longer
completely independent, it is no longer necessary that
<i>every</i> member of the <i>federal</i> union shall utter its “Yes”
to the making of any new Article of the <i>federal</i> or declaratory
kind, the only kind which governments ever
can make. And so we clearly understand, as the early
Americans in their conventions understood at once,
that the words “ratified by the legislatures of three
fourths of the several states” was to be the command
of the American people, sitting in those conventions,
that a “Yes” from three fourths of the state governments
would, thereafter, be necessary and sufficient for
the making of a new proposed <i>federal</i> or declaratory
Article. And we do <i>not</i> understand, as the Americans
in those conventions <i>never</i> understood, that those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
words implied any “<i>grant</i>” of ability to the state governments
to make <i>any</i> Articles in <i>our</i> Constitution,
much less Articles by which governments interfere or
give power to interfere with the individual freedom of
the American citizen outside the matters enumerated
in our First Article.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it becomes amazingly clear to us
that the “conventions” of the American citizens are
mentioned in the Fifth Article because the American
citizens are the important reservee of the Ninth and
Tenth Amendments. And it becomes equally clear
that the “legislatures of the several states” are mentioned
in the Fifth Article because the “states respectively”
are the <i>lesser</i> reservees named in the Tenth
Amendment.</p>

<p>The Tenth Amendment tells us that no power of <i>any
kind</i> is given, by the new Constitution, to <i>any</i> grantee
except to the new nation and <i>its</i> government, the
American government. It tells us that some powers,
which each state had hitherto possessed, are taken
from it; that the exercise of other powers, which each
state had hitherto possessed, are now prohibited to
it; and that <i>only</i> the <i>other</i> powers (<i>which each state
had hitherto possessed</i>) are <i>left</i> with that state by the
command of the supreme will in America, ourselves,
the citizens of America. It tells us emphatically that
no new powers of any kind are <i>given</i> to any state or
to any collection of states or to their governments. It
tells us that the American people, in making <i>their</i> Constitution,
left each state and each state government
powerless, as they had been, alone or in combination
with other governments, to interfere with the individual
rights of any human being outside that particular
state. And finally it tells us, what the Supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Court has expressly declared to be the most important
declaration in that Tenth Amendment, that we ourselves,
the individual citizens of America, the “people”
of the Preamble and of that Tenth Amendment, retain
(secure from any valid exercise by any government
or governments in the world and only capable of exercise
by ourselves in our “conventions”) every power
to interfere with the individual freedom of the American
citizen except in the matters enumerated in the
First Article.</p>

<p>And so, in those “conventions,” we need no constitutional
thinker to tell us the simple fact that only
those who have can give. If the state legislatures
have not, as indisputably they have not, any ability to
exercise or to grant power of <i>general</i> interference with
individual rights throughout America, and if, as the
Tenth Amendment expressly declares, the entire Constitution
adds naught to their existing ability to make
Articles of another kind, the Fifth Article merely prescribes
the <i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure, in which,
by command of the American people, that existing and
limited ability shall thereafter be exercised.</p>

<p>And likewise, if the American people themselves, the
Seventh Article “conventions” in which we are sitting,
have <i>exclusive</i> ability to exercise or to give power of
<i>general</i> interference with their own individual rights,
and if, as the Ninth and Tenth Amendments together
expressly state, those “conventions” retain that exclusive
ability, clearly the Fifth Article reference to
the same “conventions” of the American citizens is but
prescribing the <i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure in
which, by command of the American people, that exclusive
ability of <i>their own</i> shall thereafter be exercised.
When the “apt, precise and classic English” of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
the Fifth Article permits no other meaning, we cannot
imply that the Article intends to grant what one supposed
grantee (who is the supposed grantor) already
has and what the other cannot ever have. Nor can
we imply that the Article intends to provide a <i>constitutional</i>
mode of procedure in which those, who have
not, may give. Moreover, as this absurd implication
would make the individual American people “subjects,”
as soon as they adopted that Article, we now
know, with absolute certainty, that the Americans, in
the “conventions” in which we are sitting, adopted it
as their fundamental law of procedure with the only
meaning which its own “apt, precise and classic English”
permits.</p>

<p>We have now read, in those conventions of old and
with the Americans therein who made it, all of the
Madison Fifth Article save the two exceptions at the
end thereof, beginning “provided that no amendment,
etc.” In those conventions, the meaning of those two
exceptions needs but a moment’s thought. One exception
is that no change may be <i>constitutionally</i> made,
prior to 1808, in relation to the existing evil of human
slavery. The other exception is that no change may
be <i>constitutionally</i> made which shall give any state
greater representation in the Senate than each other
state. These are not exceptions to any power
“<i>granted</i>” in the Article. No power of <i>any</i> kind, as
we already know, is “<i>granted</i>” anywhere in the Article,
but the Article does <i>mention</i> two existing abilities, one
limited and the other unlimited, and prescribes the <i>constitutional</i>
mode of procedure in which each of the
respective existing abilities may be exercised. The
exceptions simply mean that the Article provides no
<i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure in which may be exercised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
existing ability to change the Constitution in
the matters mentioned in the two exceptions.</p>

<p>We average Americans have now examined carefully
the record of the wording of all our Constitution
at Philadelphia and particularly the record of the
wording of the three Articles, the First and the Seventh
and the Fifth, which either purport to give or
mention future giving (by the “people,” who alone
can give) power to interfere with the individual freedom
of the American citizen. Furthermore, we have
sat in the “conventions” of the American people, in
which all those worded Articles were made, and have
read, with the Americans in those “conventions,” the
apt, precise and classic English of the Fifth Article,
which told them, <i>as it tells us</i>, that the Article merely
prescribes the <i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure, in
which thereafter can be exercised either the existing
limited ability of the state governments or the existing
unlimited ability of the American citizens themselves,
the “conventions” of the Seventh and the Fifth Articles.
We are certain, therefore, that nowhere in the
Constitution, made in those early “conventions,” can
the most ingenious mind discover what would have
been the greatest blunder in the history of mankind,
anything which changed the actual and legal relation
of the individual American to government and made
him the “subject” of any government or collection of
governments in America. It would be unwise, however,
for us to leave those conventions without listening
to some few of the great Americans, who sat
therein, telling us how the new Constitution does <i>secure</i>
the status of the free individual American and protect
his individual freedom from all usurpation by any
government or governments in America.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br><span class="small">CONVENTIONS KNOW “CONVENTIONS” ARE “THE
PEOPLE”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“When a single government is instituted, the individuals
of which it is composed surrender to
it a part of their natural independence, which they before
enjoyed as men. When a confederate republic is
instituted, the communities of which it is composed surrender
to it a part of their political independence,
which they before enjoyed as states.... Since <i>states</i>
as well as <i>citizens</i> are represented in the Constitution
before us, and form the objects on which that Constitution
is purported to operate, it was necessary to
notice and define <i>federal</i> as well as civil liberty....
Under these impressions, and with these views, was
the late convention appointed; and under these impressions,
and with these views, the late convention
met. We now see the great end which they proposed
to accomplish. It was to frame, for the consideration
of their constituents, one <i>federal</i> and <i>national</i> Constitution
... a constitution that would insure peace,
freedom, and happiness to the states and people of
America.” (2 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 429, <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>So spoke the great Wilson, beginning his explanation
of the proposed Constitution to the first Americans
assembled in the “conventions” named in the
Seventh and Fifth Articles, the Americans in Pennsylvania.
As we listen to him, we remark the insistence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
upon the fact that the Constitution to be considered
is both a “<i>federal</i> and <i>national</i> Constitution.”
And, in strict conformity to this fact, Wilson is heard
explaining the difference between the <i>federal</i> liberty
of a state, controlled by the <i>federal</i> Articles of a constitution,
and the <i>natural</i> liberty of a man, controlled
by the <i>national</i> Articles of a constitution. We listen
to him with great interest when he tells us that this
<i>federal and national</i> Constitution has been framed to
insure “peace, freedom and happiness to the states and
the people of America.” In his words we hear the
echo of the fact so clearly declared in the Tenth
Amendment, that the <i>federal</i> powers, not delegated
in this Constitution to the new government, are reserved
“to the states respectively,” and the <i>national</i>
powers, not therein delegated, are reserved “to the
people” themselves of America.</p>

<p>And, remembering that the two distinct reservees
of the Tenth Amendment are respectively named in
the Fifth Article, we keep in mind that the new Constitution
is both “a federal and a national Constitution.”
From which we know, as Wilson knew, that
these reservees <i>are</i> named in the Fifth Article, the
“state legislatures” because of their limited ability to
make <i>federal</i> or declaratory Articles, and the “conventions”
because of their ability to make Articles <i>of
every kind</i>, the “conventions” of the Fifth and Seventh
Articles being the people themselves. As we
are actually sitting with Wilson in one of the “conventions”
of the Seventh Article, there is no possibility
of our forgetting, as none of the people in any
of those conventions ever forgot, that the “conventions”
of the Seventh Article are exactly the same as
the “conventions” of the Fifth Article and that both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
are the people of America, assembled in their “conventions.”</p>

<p>None of the Americans in those conventions could
be guilty of the ridiculous modern blunder about the
Fifth Article. None could possibly read that Article
to mean that the American citizens, “assembled in conventions,”
were granting to the American citizens,
“assembled in conventions,” any ability whatever to
<i>make</i> Articles. The modern blunder becomes clear
to us. Although the Seventh and Fifth Articles have
only been proposed and have not yet been made, we
sit in one of those “conventions” about to exercise
ability to say “Yes” to any Article, whether federal
or national. So, with amazement at the blunder of
1917 and 1920 about the Fifth Article, we listen intently
to the Wilson statement which brings home
the absurdity of the idea that the Article <i>is</i> a <i>grant</i> of
ability to make Articles.</p>

<p>As in all those conventions, he is meeting the usual
charge that the new Constitution endangers individual
liberty because it lacks a bill of rights. As in all the
conventions, he is pointing out that no bill of rights
is needed in a Constitution which gives to government
no power to interfere with individual freedom, except
the specific and enumerated powers of the First Article.
He is repudiating the thought that anywhere in
the Constitution, in its Fifth Article or elsewhere,
outside of the First Article, is there any grant to any
government of power to interfere with individual liberty.
And this is what he has to say about the Philadelphia
Convention, which ended in the preceding
September, and about the constitutional Articles that
Convention proposed, including the Fifth Article. “A
proposition to adopt a measure that would have supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
that we were throwing into the general government
every power not expressly reserved by the people,
would have been spurned, in that House, with the
greatest indignation.” (2 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 436.)</p>

<p>We Americans, who will listen later herein to some
extraordinary ideas about the Fifth Article from our
modern “constitutional” thinkers, wonder just exactly
with how much indignation the Fifth Article would
have been spurned in all the conventions of that earlier
day, if Patrick Henry or any other great opponent of
the proposed Constitution had only been able to point
out that the Fifth Article was a “grant” to a general
government (the legislative governments of some of
the states) not only of every power “expressly reserved
by the people” but also of every power given
to Congress by the First Article. We also wonder
whether the indignation would have been increased
or entirely dissipated if Henry or some other opponent
had informed those conventions, the assembled people
of America, a people so jealous of all government
interference, that the omnipotence was granted so that
the state legislatures, never elected by the American
citizens at all, might, without the slightest restraint
or any constitutional restriction, interfere with every
individual right of the American citizen.</p>

<p>While many apparently sane and reasonable modern
inhabitants of America have listened to such ideas
in the last five years as if those who advanced the ideas
were talking or thinking intelligently, we rather believe
that the Americans in those early conventions,
even from Henry, would not have received such ideas
complacently. However, as we have found in those
early Americans much of the natural humor which is
the characteristic of a human being who thinks for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
himself, we are inclined to believe that the modern
ideas in relation to the Fifth Article, about which
ideas we have just been talking, would not have been
received in any of those conventions with indignation
but would have been greeted with prolonged laughter.</p>

<p>But the Henry of those days had not the intellectual
calibre of <i>our</i> “constitutional” thinkers. Therefore,
in those conventions, not even from one of the many
bitter opponents of the proposed Constitution, do we
hear any suggestion that there lurks somewhere in the
Fifth Article, between its lines, because not hinted at
in its apt, precise and classic English, the extraordinary
grant of omnipotence to the legislative governments
of some of the states. On the contrary, in every convention,
we find the new Constitution bitterly assailed
because its provisions reduce the state governments to
that pitiable condition where Henry calls them the
weakened, enervated and defenseless state governments.
Indeed, we are inclined to mirth when we
contrast these modern ideas of the Fifth Article (that
it <i>grants</i> omnipotence over individual rights to <i>some</i>
state governments) with many of Henry’s word pictures
of the effect of the proposed Constitution on
those state governments.</p>

<p>This is one of those pictures which he exhibits to
the Americans in Virginia, assembled in their conventions:
“What shall the states have to do? Take care
of the poor, repair and make highways, erect bridges,
and so on, and so on? Abolish the state legislatures
at once. What purposes should they be continued for?
Our legislature will be indeed a ludicrous spectacle—one
hundred and eighty men marching in solemn, farcical
procession, exhibiting a mournful proof of the
lost liberty of their country, <i>without the power of restoring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
it</i>. But, sir, we have the consolation that it is
a mixed government; that is, it may work sorely on
your neck, but you have some comfort by saying, that
it was a federal government in its origin.” (3 <i>Ell.
Deb.</i> 171.)</p>

<p>Clearly, neither Henry nor the other opponents of
the new Constitution had the modern ability to discern
that it only <i>appeared</i> to deprive the state governments
of much of their former powers. They could not see,
they did not know, that its Fifth Article granted those
state governments the omnipotence over individual liberty
which the Statute of ’76 had denied to the British
Parliament. And because Henry and his colleagues
had not the discernment of <i>our</i> leaders, we hear Wilson
and the supporters of the Constitution defending
it against the plain fact that it did rob the state governments
of much of their former power. For example,
we hear Wilson saying: “The secret is now disclosed,
and it is discovered to be a dread, that the
boasted <i>state sovereignties</i> will, under this system, be
disrobed of part of their power.... I know very
well, sir, that the people have hitherto been shut out
of the federal government; but it is not meant that
they should any longer be dispossessed of their rights.
In order to recognize this leading principle, the proposed
system sets out with a declaration that its existence
depends upon the supreme authority of the people
alone.... When the principle is once settled
that the <i>people</i> are the source of authority, the consequence
is, that <i>they</i> may take from the subordinate
governments powers with which they have hitherto
trusted them, and place those powers in the general
government, if it is thought that there they will be
productive of more good. They can distribute one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
portion of power to the more contracted circle, called
<i>state governments</i>; they can also furnish another proportion
to the government of the United States. Who
will undertake to say, as a state officer, that the people
may not give to the general government what powers,
and for what purposes, they please? How comes it,
sir, that these state governments dictate to their superiors—to
the majesty of the people?... I have no
idea that a safe system of power in the government,
sufficient to manage the general interest of the United
States, could be drawn from any other source, or
vested in any other authority, than that of the people
at large; and I consider this authority as the rock on
which this structure will stand. If this principle is
unfounded, the system must fall.... With how
much contempt have we seen the authority of the
people treated by the legislature of this state!” (2
<i>Ell. Deb.</i> 443, <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>But we cannot stay much longer in the Pennsylvania
Convention. It would be unwise, however, for us to
depart therefrom without hearing the accurate confirmation
of our own reading and understanding of
the Fifth Article from its own “apt, precise and classic
English.” Wilson was explaining his opposition to the
doctrine that a constitution is a compact between a
master government and servant people. In other
words, he was explaining the American Statute of ’76,
stating the legal principle that Americans are not “subjects.”
“The citizens of united America, I presume,
do not wish to stand on that footing with those to
whom, from convenience, they please to delegate the
exercise of the general powers necessary for sustaining
and preserving the Union. They wish a principle
established, by the operation of which the legislatures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
may feel the direct authority of the people. The
<i>people</i>, possessing that authority, will continue to exercise
it by amending and improving their own work.”
(2 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 498.)</p>

<p>To us average Americans this seems like sound
American law and in strict keeping with our reading
of the plain language of the Fifth Article, as we read
it with the Americans in those old conventions. Wilson
and his associates seem to know <i>with certainty</i> that
the Fifth Article is not to change all the free individual
Americans into “subjects” of the legislative
governments of which he speaks. Indeed, he calls all
those free Americans, to some of whom he was speaking,
“the citizens of America,” although the nation of
America would not exist and they would not be its
citizens until they and the Americans, <i>in</i> eight other
conventions, had said “Yes” to the Constitution they
were discussing. Therefore, when he speaks of that
Constitution as establishing a principle “by the operation
of which the legislatures may feel the direct authority
of the people” or “citizens of America,” and
immediately adds that those citizens, possessing the
<i>exclusive</i> authority to exercise and vest ability to interfere
with individual freedom, “will continue to exercise
it by amending and improving their own work,”
the enumerated grants of such authority in the First
Article, we realize with certainty that he and his associates
know that the Fifth Article in that Constitution
does not mean that the legislatures (who are to feel
the direct authority of the people) can thereafter exercise
the authority of the citizens of America by altering,
subtracting from or adding to the First Article
quantum of delegated power to interfere with the
individual freedom of the American people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>In this convention, where the Americans in Pennsylvania
are assembled, we have heard the consistent
emphasis laid upon the fact that the Constitution is
both a <i>federal</i> and a <i>national</i> Constitution, the distinction
from all other constitutions so clearly recognized
by the Fifth Article mention of the two makers of
Articles. Later herein we will learn how this distinctive
quality of our Constitution, this distinction recognized
in its Fifth Article as well as in its Tenth Amendment,
has neither been felt or acknowledged but has
been wholly ignored by our modern “constitutional”
thinkers for five years last past. At this point, therefore,
it is well that we sit for a moment in the Virginia
convention and listen to Henry, the greatest and most
determined opponent of the Constitution before it was
adopted. With our minds fixed upon the language
of the Fifth Article and its clear mention of the exclusive
existing ability of “conventions” to make national
Articles, a mention emphasized by the equally clear
recognition of the limited ability of the legislative
state governments to make Articles which are <i>not</i>
national, it is interesting to hear Henry refer to the
difference between <i>federal</i> and <i>national</i> Articles; and
it is more than interesting, it is amazingly important
to hear him proving, <i>by the fact that the Americans in
Virginia are</i> assembled in one of the “conventions,”
that the Articles which have been just proposed from
Philadelphia, <i>are national</i> and, therefore, of the kind
that legislative governments can never make.</p>

<p>It is Thursday, June 5, 1788, the day on which
began the immortal Virginia debate. For a year, since
the proposal from Philadelphia, the new Articles have
been the subject of the severest scrutiny on the part
of those determined to secure the rejection of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
Articles by the American people in Virginia. Throughout
all America, these Articles have been examined
and assailed and condemned in public writing and
speech by those equally determined to secure their
rejection by the Americans assembled in the other
“conventions.” On the other hand, the same Articles
have been explained and their necessity, if American
individual liberty is to be secure, has been demonstrated
in the famous essays which we now know as
<i>The Federalist</i>, nearly all of which essays were the
work of Madison and Hamilton, who are responsible
for the wording and the meaning of the Fifth Article.
Like the other “conventions,” assembling when all
minds sought the best protection for individual liberty
against oppressive governments, the members of the
Virginia convention have been carefully chosen to
speak the will of the Americans in Virginia by a
simple “Yes” or “No” to these seven Articles, the
first of which constitutes government ability to interfere
with individual liberty.</p>

<p>Could anything be more vitally important to individual
liberty than that just such “conventions,” so
chosen, not the state legislatures, each elected by the
citizens of its own state <i>for an entirely different purpose</i>,
should continue to have their exclusive ability to
determine <i>how much</i> power to interfere with individual
freedom shall be surrendered by the American people,
and how the quantum (which <i>is</i> surrendered) shall
be apportioned for exercise between the one American
government and the respective states and their respective
legislative governments? Later herein we shall
learn how clearly Madison and Hamilton, responsible
for the wording and meaning of the Fifth Article,
knew and appreciated the practical and amazing importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
as security to individual liberty, in this distinction
between the <i>two</i> makers (“conventions” of the
American people themselves and state “legislatures”)
named in their Fifth Article and in the distinction between
their respective and <i>existing</i> abilities to make
Articles in a Constitution which is both a <i>federal</i> and
<i>national</i> Constitution. And, as we know, as the Supreme
Court has declared in the voice of the Marshall
who sits with us in that Virginia convention, the knowledge
and appreciation was not peculiar to Madison
and Hamilton. It was the common knowledge and
appreciation of all the Americans who <i>made</i> the Fifth
Article in those conventions. “To the formation of a
league, such as was the Confederation, the state sovereignties
were certainly competent”; but when a grant
of enumerated power to interfere with individual freedom
was asked, “the legal necessity of referring it to
the people and of deriving its powers directly from
them was felt and acknowledged by all.” When such
a grant is asked, whether it be asked in the shape of
the First Article or of the Eighteenth Amendment, it
is not referred to the people at all, unless it is sent
to them to be considered and discussed <i>before</i> they
choose, from among themselves, those of themselves
who will assemble in the “conventions” for the one
and sole purpose of uttering the carefully weighed
“Yes” or “No” of the Americans in the state where
the particular convention assembles. As all in those
early conventions knew, as Marshall declared from
the Supreme Court, <i>that</i> assembling in those “conventions”
is the only way in which the American people
can act “safely, effectively and wisely” when asked for
a grant of power to interfere with individual freedom,
and, as the Statute of ’76 and good sense and practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
experience alike teach all free men, that is the only
way in which any just power of government can be
derived “directly” from the citizens upon whom it is
to be exercised.</p>

<p>We commend a careful thought of this distinction,
vital and important to individual human liberty, to the
constitutional thinkers of 1917 and 1920. Whenever
they read a Fifth Article which included the words
“or in conventions in three fourths thereof,” they have
assumed that two makers of Articles were named in
the amending procedure of the Constitution (which
is both <i>federal</i> and <i>national</i>) in order that Congress,
when <i>it</i> wanted new power to interfere with individual
freedom, might weigh the chance of getting it from
each maker and then ask it either from those who
reserved it exclusively to themselves, the “people” of
the Tenth Amendment, or from those who never had
it or the ability to grant it, the other reservee of the
Tenth Amendment, “the states respectively” and their
governments. Or perhaps it was the concept of these
modern constitutional thinkers that the Fifth Article
mentions two makers of Articles merely that Congress
may choose either, according to its whim, as a fortunate
golfer chooses between his two golf suits. That
is their idea of the security to human individual liberty
against government usurpation which Madison and
Hamilton and the American people established about
eleven years after they declared that no just power
to interfere with human freedom could ever be obtained,
except from the citizens with whose individual
liberty the exercise of the power was to interfere!</p>

<p>As Henry and his fellow Americans in the Virginia
convention had no such absurd concept, we return to
hear him charge that the Philadelphia Convention had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
exceeded its authority in proposing the Constitution
of <i>national</i> government and to prove that the proposed
Constitution <i>was</i> national by the fact that the Americans
in Virginia are assembled in “convention” to say
“Yes” or “No” to that Constitution, whereas, if it
had consisted only of <i>federal</i> Articles, it would have
been sent to the legislatures.</p>

<p>“The distinction between a national government and
a confederacy is not sufficiently discerned. Had the
delegates, who were sent to Philadelphia, a power to
propose a consolidated government instead of a confederacy?
Were they not deputed by <i>states</i>, and not
by the <i>people</i>? The assent of the <i>people</i>, in their collective
capacity, is not necessary to the formation of
a <i>federal</i> government.... They are not the proper
agents for this purpose. States and foreign powers
are the only proper agents <i>for this kind</i> of government.
Show me an instance where the people have
exercised this business. Has it not always gone
through the legislatures?... Are the people, therefore,
in their aggregate capacity, the proper persons
to form a <i>confederacy</i>? This, therefore, ought to
depend on the consent of the legislatures, the people
having never sent delegates to make any proposition
for changing the government.” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 52.)</p>

<p>In these words, as always in the convention where
we sit and listen to him, Henry attests the universal
knowledge, common to advocate and opponent of the
proposed Constitution, that the Constitution has not
been referred to the state governments because of their
absolute inability to constitute government of individuals,
to give to government any power to interfere
with individual liberty. In this, he and the others but
echo the knowledge of the Americans at Concord, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
that October day, eleven years earlier, where they
returned a proposed Constitution with Articles <i>of that
kind</i> to the legislature which had proposed it. We
recall their own statements that even a <i>supreme</i> legislative
government “either in their proper capacity or
in joint committee, are by no means a body proper to
form and establish a Constitution.” We recall their
statements of the important knowledge that “a Constitution,
alterable” even “by the supreme legislative,
is no security at all against the encroachment of the
governing part on any or on all their rights and privileges.”
But we also hear, in these words of Henry,
his knowledge—the knowledge of all Americans at
that time—of something else interesting and important
to us. We hear him twice identify the assembling of
the American people, in the “conventions” named in
the Seventh <i>and the Fifth</i> Articles, as the people “in
their collective capacity” and the people “in their aggregate
capacity.” As we hear him, and as we hear
Wilson in the Pennsylvania convention stating that
“in this Constitution <i>the citizens of America</i> appear
dispensing a portion of their power,” as we hear similar
statements in all those “conventions,” we sense
the universal knowledge of all those conventions that
they are the <i>American</i> people, the citizens of the <i>new
republic</i>. And later herein, with our education of 1790
completed by sitting in these very conventions, we intend
to listen (with amazement and without the slightest
belief) to the remarkable statements of 1917 and
1920, that the states, political entities, made our Constitution
or that the citizens of the different states, in
their capacity as <i>such</i> citizens, gave to the <i>American</i>
government the enumerated First Article powers to
interfere with the individual liberty of the citizens of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
that entirely different and greater nation, America.
Impressed by Henry’s knowledge that the conventions
which made the Constitution were the people of America,
“in their collective capacity,” “in their aggregate
capacity,” and impressed with Wilson’s knowledge that
“the citizens of America”—not the states or the citizens
<i>of the states</i>—“are seen dispensing a portion of
their power,” we are going to laugh at the concepts
of 1917 and 1920 and know that Marshall was right
when he said, speaking of the American people and
their assembling in those “conventions”: “It is true,
they assembled in their several states, and where else
could they have assembled?... When <i>they</i> act,
<i>they</i> act <i>in</i> their states. But the measures they adopt
do not, on that account, cease to be the measures of
<i>the people themselves</i> or become the measures of the
<i>state governments</i>.”</p>

<p>Yet, when we later come to the modern days of
1917 and 1920, we shall see all <i>our</i> leaders, whether
for or against the Eighteenth Amendment, blandly
assume a most extraordinary meaning from the Fifth
Article mention of the state legislatures. Not a single
member of any state legislature is elected by the citizens
of America. Moreover, the Tenth Amendment
expressly declares that the Constitution—that great
power of attorney from American citizens to their only
American government—gives no power whatever to
the states or <i>their</i> governments. Nevertheless, with
amusement and absolute incredulity, we shall hear
every statesman of 1917 and every lawyer of 1920
assume and act and argue upon the extraordinary concept
that the Fifth Article of that Constitution is a
great power of attorney to the state legislatures as
attorneys in fact for the American citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“We all know the severe scrutiny to which the Constitution
was exposed—some from their own knowledge,
others from different sources. We know with
what jealousy, with what watchfulness, with what
scrupulous care its minutest provisions were examined,
discussed, resisted, and supported by those who opposed
and those who advocated its ratification.” (4
<i>Ell. Deb.</i> 486.) So spoke Martin Van Buren in the
Senate on April 7, 1826. We sit in the conventions
which made the Constitution of which he spoke. We
listen to every word that is said therein. We hear
the Fifth Article explained by its worder, Madison, as
nothing but a mode of procedure. From not one of
the opponents of the Constitution, not even from
Henry, do we hear a single word of attack upon the
Fifth Article except as to the weakness of the mode
of procedure which it provides for <i>evoking</i> the power
of the “people” themselves, assembled in “conventions”
of the very same kind, to withdraw from the
one American legislature, the Congress, some enumerated
power of the First Article which is found oppressive
to individual liberty. On the contrary, we not
only hear <i>no</i> single word of complaint that the Fifth
Article or any Article gives one iota of power to the
state legislatures, but the whole complaint of all the
opponents of the Constitution which we <i>do</i> hear is that
it practically destroys all existing ability and power
of those state governments. Only a moment ago we
have heard Henry ask: “If you adopt this Constitution,
why continue the state legislatures at all?”</p>

<p>Anticipating the extraordinary concept which we are
later to hear in 1917 and 1920, that the citizens of
America by the Fifth Article made a collection of the
state legislatures an omnipotent government over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
everything in America, including every individual right,
we wonder if the constitutional thinkers of 1917 and
1920 remember that we are sitting with a people who,
just five years before the conventions in which they
and we sit, ended an eight-year war to make certain
that there never again should be a government of that
kind in America, to make certain that they themselves
should never be the “subjects” of any government or
the citizens of any nation whose government should
have even one power to interfere with individual liberty,
except power <i>of that kind</i> granted directly by its
citizens themselves.</p>

<p>It was Maclaine in the North Carolina convention
who first used the exact expression that the Americans,
who sit in the conventions where we are, were a people
“better acquainted with the science of government
than any other people in the world.” In the same convention,
on July 29, 1788, this is what he had to say
about the consistent attack upon the Constitution, because
it robbed the state legislative governments of
so much of their previous power. “Mr. Chairman,
that it <i>will</i> destroy the state sovereignty is a very
popular argument.... Government is formed for
the happiness and prosperity of the people at large.
The powers given it are for <i>their</i> own good....
The powers to be given the general government are
proposed to be withdrawn from the authority of the
state governments, in order to protect and secure the
union at large. This proposal is made to the <i>people</i>.
No man will deny their authority to delegate powers
and recall them, in all free countries.... It may be
justly said that it [the Constitution which contains the
Fifth Article] diminishes the power of the state legislatures,
<i>and the diminution is necessary to the safety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
and prosperity of the people</i>.” (4 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 180.) It
certainly would have surprised Maclaine, as well as all
the Americans in those conventions, to have heard any
one of themselves stating that the same Constitution
vested the state governments with an omnipotence they
had never possessed, the very omnipotence denied to
the British Parliament eleven years earlier.</p>

<p>In the Virginia convention we hear Madison, who
drafted and suggested the Fifth Article at Philadelphia,
speak of the important distinction between the
makers of the <i>federal</i> Articles of 1781, only seven
years made, when we sit in that Virginia convention,
and the “convention” makers of the proposed Articles
of the new <i>national</i> Constitution. If these “conventions”
make it, he says, it will be a government established,
not through the intervention of the legislatures
<i>but by the people at large</i>. Fie goes on to say “In this
particular respect, the distinction between the existing
and proposed governments is very material. The existing
system has been derived from the dependent
derivative authority of the legislatures of the <i>states</i>;
whereas this is derived from the <i>superior</i> power of the
<i>people</i>. If we look at the manner in which alterations
are to be made,” now referring directly to the Fifth
Article, “the same idea is, in some degree, attended
to.” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 94.)</p>

<p>We feel that it will be quite difficult, when we come
later to the constitutional thinkers of 1917 and 1920,
for them to convince us that Madison meant his Fifth
Article to alter “the dependent derivative authority of
the legislatures of the state” and, whenever another
government makes the suggestion, put that dependent
authority above what he calls “the superior power of
the people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>And we feel that these “constitutional thinkers” will
find it impossible to convince us when we recall Madison’s
other words, directly referring to his Fifth Article
and the existing power of the people, mentioned
therein by the word “conventions.” These are the
words to which we allude: “Were it [his Fifth Article]
wholly national, the supreme and ultimate authority
would reside in the <i>majority</i> of the people of the
Union, and this authority would be competent at all
times, like that of a majority of every national society,
to alter or abolish its established government.” It is
Madison himself who puts the one word “majority”
in italics. He does so to call attention to the fact
that his Article leaves “the supreme and ultimate authority”
in the <i>people</i> (named as “conventions” in his
Article) but not necessarily capable of exercise by the
<i>majority</i> in any <i>constitutional</i> manner. He goes on to
explain this very fact by saying that when the mode
of procedure prescribed in his Article is read, it is
found that “in requiring more than a majority, and
particularly in computing the proportion by <i>states</i>, not
by <i>citizens</i>, it departs from the <i>national</i> and advances
towards the <i>federal</i> character.” (<i>Fed.</i> No. 39.)</p>

<p>In New York we find Hamilton, who seconded the
suggestion of Madison’s Fifth Article at Philadelphia,
almost immediately after he had stated that there
would be no danger in permitting Congress to <i>propose</i>
amendments since “the final decision in the case will
rest with the people.” As we recall, Hamilton said
this when the tentative Fifth Article mentioned no one
but the people, “conventions,” as the maker of future
Articles, because he and Madison and their associates
at Philadelphia, whose minds had so far been concentrated
upon the <i>national</i> First Article, had not yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
grasped the fact, later stated by Hamilton to be his
conviction, that all future changes would probably relate
“to the organization of government and <i>not to the
mass of its powers</i>.” We are, therefore, interested to
find Hamilton, in New York, on Friday, December 14,
1787, pointing out that “It has not a little contributed
to the infirmities of the existing <i>federal</i> system that it
never had a ratification by the <span class="allsmcap">PEOPLE</span>. Resting on no
better foundation than the consent of the several legislatures,
it has been exposed to frequent and intricate
questions concerning the validity of its powers....
The possibility of a question of this nature proves the
necessity of laying the foundations of our <i>national</i> government
[the First Article grant of national powers]
deeper than in the mere sanction of delegated authority
[referring directly to the state legislatures which
are mentioned in the Fifth Article]. The fabric of
American empire ought to rest on the solid basis <span class="allsmcap">OF
THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE</span>. The streams of <i>national</i>
power ought to flow immediately from that
pure, original fountain of all legitimate authority.”
(<i>Fed.</i> No. 22.) The capitals are those of Hamilton
himself. We rather feel that his stress upon the “<span class="allsmcap">PEOPLE</span>”
sharply contrasted with the state “legislatures,”
as the only legitimate direct source of <i>national</i> power,
such as is granted in the First Article and the Eighteenth
Amendment, will be somewhat of a shock to the
“constitutional thinkers” of 1917 and 1920. Sitting
in the conventions of old, we rather recognize the
capitalized words, where Hamilton says that <i>national</i>
power in America “ought to rest on the solid basis of
the <span class="allsmcap">CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE</span>,” as a direct echo from
the Statute of ’76, enacted only eleven years before
those conventions. That Statute says that every just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
power of government must be derived directly from
the governed.</p>

<p>And we become rather convinced that Hamilton and
Madison, when submitting the Fifth Article at Philadelphia,
never worded it so that <i>national</i> power in
America could be granted through the illegitimate authority
of the state legislatures, when we read what
either one or both of them have to say on Tuesday,
February 5, 1788, in <i>The Federalist</i>, No. 49. “As
the people are the only legitimate fountain of power,
and it is from them that the constitutional charter,
under which the several branches of government hold
their power, is derived, it seems strictly consonant to
the republican theory to recur to the same original
authority”—a direct reference to the “conventions”
of the <i>Seventh and the Fifth</i> Articles—“whenever it
may be necessary to enlarge, diminish, or new-model
the powers of government.”</p>

<p>If we ever had any doubt as to what Hamilton
meant the Fifth Article to provide, our doubt is ended
forever when we hear Hamilton, in the New York
Convention, speak of the state legislatures, which the
“constitutional thinkers” of 1917 and 1920 assume to
have been made attorney in fact for the American
people for every purpose by that Fifth Article. “Look
through their history,” he says, speaking of those state
legislative governments. “What factions have arisen
from the most trifling causes! What intrigues have
been practiced for the most illiberal purposes! Is not
the State of Rhode Island, at this moment, struggling
under difficulties and distresses, for having been led
blindly by the spirit of the multitude? What is her
legislature but the picture of a <i>mob</i>?” Most of the
states “are either governed by a single democratic assembly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
or have a senate constituted entirely upon
democratic principles. These have been more or less
embroiled in factions, and have generally been the
image and echo of the multitude.... <i>Let us beware
that we do not make the state legislatures a vehicle in
which the evil humors may be conveyed into the national
system.</i>” (2 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 317.) When Hamilton
knew that these state legislatures were not the legitimate
source of national powers in a republic and when
he had <i>this</i> view of their general character, will any
sane man believe that he advocated that the citizens
of America should make these legislatures (although
the citizens of America elect not a single member in
them) absolute attorney in fact for the citizens of
America for all purposes? Will any sane man believe
that he proposed to substitute them, as grantors of
<i>national</i> power, for the “conventions” of the Fifth
Article, which “conventions” already excited the admiration
of the entire world, according to the author
of the Fifth Article, as the only safe or effective mode
in which the free citizens of a nation could vest its
government with any power to interfere with their
own individual liberty.</p>

<p>“The authority of Constitutions over governments,
and the sovereignty of the people over Constitutions,
are truths which are at all times necessary to be kept
in mind; <i>and at no time, perhaps, more necessary than
at present</i>.” This impressive statement of the truth
that the “governments,” state “legislatures,” never
were placed by the Fifth Article above the Constitution
in which it is, and above the sovereignty of the
people, mentioned therein as “conventions,” and cannot
be placed there by another government, the Congress,
is not a statement made in the heat of the controversy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
about the Eighteenth Amendment. It is the
statement of James Madison, author of the Fifth
Article, made in the Virginia House of Delegates in
1799;</p>

<p>It is becoming almost impossible for us, as we sit
in these conventions and hear every word that is said,
to understand the source of the modern thought, if we
can dignify it by calling it “thought,” that the Fifth
Article is a power of attorney from the citizens of
America to the state governments, every member of
which is elected by the citizens of the respective states
and not by the citizens of America. It is beginning to
grow upon us that any such “thought” is based on
sheer assumption and that the entire record of the
“conventions” is a closed book to those who hold the
assumption. We know that they have the explicit
statement of the Tenth Amendment, that the Constitution
gives no power of any kind to any donee except the
one new American government, the government with
the enumerated powers of the First Article. As no
power of attorney was ever written or can be conceived
except one which grants the attorney in fact some
power, the Tenth Amendment makes absolutely certain
that neither the Fifth Article nor the entire Constitution
gives to the state legislatures any power as attorneys
in fact for the citizens of America.</p>

<p>Moreover, breathing the atmosphere of those first
“conventions” of the kind named in the Seventh <i>and
the Fifth</i> Articles, the “conventions” where individual
liberty of the American is the only object of advocate
and opponent of the Articles under consideration, we
begin to sense that the holders of the impossible assumption
have never fully grasped the amazing and
vital distinction between “state legislatures” and “conventions”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
of the kind named in the Seventh <i>and the
Fifth</i> Articles. When we shall hear the “constitutional
thinkers” of 1917 and 1920 speak of the “legislatures”
and the “conventions” as two different agents given
omnipotent attorneyship in fact over all the individual
rights of the citizens of America, we shall wonder if
these thinkers appreciate that the “state legislatures”
are permanent bodies, always existing, and that the
“conventions” of the Fifth Article are, to the “conventions”
in which we sit, bodies that never would have
an existence until some future moment, when the
American citizens themselves would again be called to
assemble in and thus make those “conventions.” Nothing
could show more clearly that the “conventions” of
the Seventh Article looked upon the “conventions” of
the Fifth Article, not as the donee of any power of
attorney, but as themselves or their posterity, the
citizens of America, assembling again to determine
whether there shall be any change in the distribution
of power to interfere with their individual liberty.
And our thought, re-echoed again and again by Marshall
and others from the Bench of the Supreme Court
in the century that follows the first assembling of these
“conventions,” seems but the repetition of what we
hear said in the Massachusetts Convention as the
tribute of its Americans to the Fifth Article.</p>

<p>On January 23, 1788, the Americans, assembled in
Massachusetts, took up the consideration of that Article.
As in every convention, there had been great
opposition to the earlier Articles; as in every convention,
nearly all of it had been to the great national
powers of the First Article granted to the new government
and taken from the state governments; and, as
in every convention, almost all of this opposition had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
been the continued complaint that the state governments
were being destroyed.</p>

<p>It was not that the Americans loved the state governments.
The truth is that, like every natural human
being, they objected to all governments. Their sole
thought was fear of oppressive government infringement
upon their individual liberty. In this respect, the
Americans in each convention feared their own legislative
government less than the new proposed Congress,
because they would elect all the members of the
former and only a few members of the latter. If it
had been suggested, by any of the many opponents of
the new Constitution, that any possible twisting of the
words of the Fifth Article meant that governments
outside their state, not one of whose members they
themselves would elect, could infringe upon their every
individual right, without any constitutional restraint,
the record of every convention would have been one
unanimous “<span class="allsmcap">NO</span>,” against the new Constitution. But,
as no “constitutional thinker” of 1917 or 1920 sat in
any of those conventions, no such suggestion was ever
made therein.</p>

<p>And so, on that January 23, we hear the Fifth
Article read in that Massachusetts convention, and we
see Rufus King rising and we hear him state that “He
believed gentlemen had not, in their objections to the
Constitution, recollected that this Article was a part
of it; for many of the arguments of gentlemen were
founded on the idea of future amendments being impracticable.”
He dwelt “on the superior excellence of
the proposed Constitution in this particular, and called
upon gentlemen to produce an instance, in any other
<i>national</i> constitution, where the <i>people</i> had so fair an
opportunity to correct any abuse which might take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
place in the future administration of the government
under it.”</p>

<p>And then we hear Dr. Jarvis: “Mr. President, I
cannot suffer the present Article to be passed, without
rising to express my entire and perfect approbation of
it. Whatever may have been my private opinion of
any other part, or whatever faults or imperfections
I have remarked, or fancied I have seen, in any other
instance, here, sir, I have found complete satisfaction:
this has been a resting place, on which I have reposed
myself in the fullest security, whenever a doubt has
occurred, in considering any other passage in the proposed
Constitution. The honorable gentleman last
speaking has called upon those persons who are opposed
to our receiving the present system, to show
another government, in which such <i>a wise precaution</i>
has been taken to secure to the <i>people</i> the right of making
such alterations and amendments, in a peaceable
way, as experience shall have proved to be necessary.
Allow me to say, sir, as far as the narrow limits of
my own information extend, I know of no such example.
In other countries, sir,—unhappily for mankind,—the
history of their respective revolutions has
been written in blood; and it is in this only that any
great or important change in our political situation has
been effected, without public commotions. When we
shall have adopted the Constitution before us, we shall
have in this Article an adequate provision for all the
purposes of political reformation. If, in the course of
its operation, this government shall appear to be too
severe, here are the means by which this severity may
be assuaged and corrected.... <i>We</i> have united
against the British; <i>we</i> have united in calling the late
federal convention; and <i>we</i> may certainly unite again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
in such alterations as in reason shall appear to be important
for the peace and happiness of America.” (2
<i>Ell. Deb.</i> 116.)</p>

<p>No man ever voiced such sentiments, no conventions
of Americans ever listened to them, with any knowledge
or thought that the Fifth Article, “the wise precaution”
to secure the liberty of the individual if the
government with the national powers of the First Article
oppressed that liberty, was itself a grant to
another government, ten legislatures outside of the
Massachusetts in which that convention was held, to
infringe upon the individual liberty of every American
in Massachusetts on every subject without any constitutional
restraint.</p>

<p>And so, we average Americans end our education in
the only “conventions,” named in the Seventh or the
Fifth Articles, which yet have assembled. And we end
that education knowing that there is nothing anywhere
in the Constitution those conventions adopted, and
especially nothing in the Fifth Article, which changed
the free American into a subject of any government or
governments in America. Everything we have heard—and
what we have repeated is but little of what we
have heard—serves but to emphasize the only meaning
of its “apt, precise and classic English,” the plain
meaning which we got from its language when we read
it at the beginning of these conventions with the Americans
who made it.</p>

<p>It is, as its author explained it, naught but a constitutional
mode of procedure in which may be thereafter
exercised, in a <i>constitutional</i> manner, either the
limited ability of state governments to make Articles
which do not concern themselves with the infringement
of individual liberty or the unlimited ability of the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
themselves, the “conventions” of the kind in which
we have sat, to make any Articles. The procedure prescribed
for such constitutional exercise is simplicity
itself to those who sit in those conventions. It is exactly
the procedure just followed (up to the point
where the work of any proposer of a new Article and
its mode of ratification must end) by the Philadelphia
Convention which drafted it and the other six Articles.
The Philadelphia Convention found itself without any
<span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode of procedure in which could be
evoked to exercise the existing and exclusive power of
the people of America to grant any government power
to infringe upon the individual liberty of the American
citizens. There being no <i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure,
no designated body to draft Articles with such
grants and to propose them and to ascertain and propose
the <i>valid</i> mode of ratification for them, the Philadelphia
Convention did that work, guided only by basic
American doctrine, the Statute of ’76 and the experience
of the “conventions” which had made the national
Articles of 1776. It followed a certain mode of procedure
in the doing of these things, knowing and stating
that to draft Articles and propose them and
ascertain and propose the right mode of ratification
for them is not the exercise of any power. With a
knowledge which we of a later generation never should
have forgotten—and which we who have been educated
with them never will forget—the Philadelphia
Convention knew that there were two makers of Articles
in America, each of which had exercised its
respective and different ability to make them, during
the eleven years which preceded the Philadelphia Convention.
They knew that every Article that was
<i>national</i> could be made by no one but the people themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
the “conventions,” which had made the <i>national</i>
Articles of ’76 and which are named as the makers
of all future Articles <i>of that kind</i> in the Seventh and
the Fifth Articles proposed by Philadelphia.</p>

<p>And so, when the Philadelphia Convention had
drafted its Articles and was about to propose them, it
recognized the legal necessity of ascertaining, from the
nature of those Articles, whether they were in the
power of both or only of one of those existing makers
of Articles. In the ascertainment, with their minds on
the First Article grants of national power to interfere
with individual liberty, they knew that no governments
in America could make an Article <i>of that kind</i>. Their
ascertainment was then ended and they knew that they
<i>must</i> propose that mode of ratification which would
send their Articles to the only valid ratifiers, the people
themselves, the “conventions” of the Seventh and the
Fifth Articles.</p>

<p>This was the procedure they had followed, when
there was no <i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure provided.
And so, with the extraordinary wisdom that
characterized everything they did, that Philadelphia
Convention wrote exactly the same procedure into the
Fifth Article so that never again there might be lacking
in America a <i>constitutional</i> mode of procedure for
the evoking and the exercise of the only power that is
ever exercised when constitutional Articles are made,
the power of making them. As the Philadelphia Convention
ended its existence with its own proposals,
some new body had to do that work, when any new
Article was to be proposed. As the work of the Philadelphia
Convention had not been the exercise of any
power but merely the work of proposing, it was a
certainty that the new <i>constitutional</i> mode, exactly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
same mode as that of Philadelphia, would also be the
exercise of no power. And so, the Philadelphia Convention
named the Congress (or a convention demanded
by the state legislatures) to do the work of the Philadelphia
Convention in drafting and proposing any new
Article, and it named the Congress to perform the
duty of ascertaining (by the nature of the new drafted
Article) <i>which</i> of the two makers could make it, and
then to propose a mode of ratification by which it
would be <i>validly</i> ratified by such competent maker. As
to the only powers ever to be exercised in the making
of any new Article, the power of legislatures to make
<i>federal</i> Articles, and the exclusive power of the people
or “conventions” to make <i>national</i> Articles, the <i>constitutional</i>
mode of procedure did not (nor could it,
if Americans were not to become “subjects”) give the
governments any of the exclusive ability of the people
or “conventions,” and it did not (nor could it, if
America were to be a republic) alter the existing ability
of the majority of the American people to make
their governments what they will. But, for the very
practical purpose which Madison so clearly explained,
the purpose of providing some check upon the
tyranny of the majority or an aggressive minority over
the individual rights of all Americans, the Fifth Article
procedure could and did fail to provide any <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span>
method in which government power to
interfere with individual liberty, as all surrendered
power <i>of that kind</i> was distributed between different
governments in the Constitution, could be changed in
any way or transferred from one government to another,
unless the “conventions” of the American citizens
<i>in</i> three fourths of the states said “Yes” to any
proposed change or transfer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>The Philadelphia Convention having proposed this
particular check upon the existing ability of the people
themselves to oppress individual liberty, a check which
makes the words “by conventions in three fourths
thereof” by far the most important words, the Fifth
Article goes on to prescribe exactly the same check on
the exercise of the ability of the state legislatures to
make <i>federal</i> Articles.</p>

<p>That the Fifth Article, a constitutional mode of
procedure for the exercise of two different existing
abilities, was <i>not a grant</i> of any power to the state
legislative governments is something that was known
to every man in the conventions which made that Fifth
Article.</p>

<p>In the Pennsylvania convention, Wilson plainly
stated the knowledge of all that the supreme power
“<i>resides</i> in the people, as the fountain of government;
that the people have not—that the people meant not—and
that the people ought not—to part with it to
any government whatsoever. In their hands it remains
secure. They can delegate it in such proportions to
such bodies, on such terms, and under such limitations,
as they think proper. I agree with the members in
opposition, that there cannot be two sovereign powers
on the same subject.... My position is, sir, that,
in this country, the supreme, absolute, and uncontrollable
power resides in the people at large.” (2
<i>Ell. Deb.</i> 456 et seq.)</p>

<p>When more than half a century had passed, the
same thing was known to those who knew American
Constitutional Law.</p>

<p>“It is obviously impossible for the whole people to
meet, prepare and discuss the proposed alterations,
and there seems to be no feasible mode by which an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
expression of <i>their</i> will can be obtained, except by
asking it upon the single point of assent or disapproval.
But no body of representatives, <i>unless specially clothed
with power for that purpose by the people when choosing
them</i>, [ergo, no permanent state governments or
legislatures] can rightfully take definitive action upon
amendments or revisions; they must submit the result
of their deliberations to the people—<span class="allsmcap">WHO ALONE ARE
COMPETENT TO EXERCISE THE POWERS OF SOVEREIGNTY
IN FRAMING THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW</span>—for
ratification or rejection.”</p>

<p>So spoke the great Cooley in reference to making
changes in <i>national</i> constitutions in his work on Constitutional
Limitations (7th ed., 1903, at p. 61).</p>

<p>When one hundred and seventeen years had passed
since the conventions in which we just sat, the same
thing was known in the Supreme Court, in 1907.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The powers the people have given to the General Government
are named in the Constitution, and all not there

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br><span class="small">SEVENTEEN ARTICLES RESPECT HUMAN FREEDOM</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“For my own part, I acknowledge a thorough conviction
that Amendments which may, upon mature
consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable
to the organization of the government, not to the mass
of its powers.” (<i>Fed.</i> No. 85.)</p>

<p>This was the statement of Hamilton to the American
people when he was asking them, about to assemble
in their conventions, to make their First Article
grants of enumerated powers to interfere with their
individual freedom and to make their Fifth Article
mode of procedure, in which they could exercise
<span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONALLY</span> their exclusive ability, assembled
again in “conventions,” to add or subtract from that
grant of enumerated powers of that kind.</p>

<p>When he used the words, “mass of its powers,” he
referred directly to that First Article grant. It contains
all the powers that were ever given to any government
to interfere with the individual freedom of
the American citizen. He knew what the Supreme
Court clearly declared in United States v. Cruikshank,
92 <i>U. S.</i> 542, that, beyond the scope of its enumerated
powers, there is <i>no</i> government of the American citizens.
He knew that, in the geographical territory
which is each state, there would thereafter be two governments,
the government of enumerated powers,
governing the American citizens in that state under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
First Article grants from the American citizens, and
the state governments, governing the citizens of the
state, under whatever grants of national power its
state citizens gave that government.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The two governments in each state stand in their respective
spheres of action in the same independent relation
to each other, except in one particular, that they would
if their authority embraced distinct territories. That particular
consists in the supremacy of the authority of the
United States when any conflict arises between the two
governments. (Justice Field, in Tarble’s case, in the Supreme
Court, 13 <i>Wall.</i> 397.)</p>
</div>

<p>With such knowledge, he would have found it impossible
to make the blunder of assuming that either
government could give or join with governments in
giving to the other any power to interfere with the
citizens of the grantee in their enjoyment of individual
liberty. He knew that, “In our republican forms of
government, the absolute sovereignty of the nation is
in the people of the nation; and the residuary sovereignty
of each state, not granted to any of its public
functionaries, is in the people of the state.” (Story,
1 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 65.)</p>

<p>When Hamilton stated, in those days of 1788, his
conviction that new Articles would relate to the “organization
of government and not to the mass of its
powers,” he was epitomizing the common knowledge
of everyone, at that time, that the new Constitution
was both <i>federal</i> and <i>national</i>. He was predicting that
the power to interfere with individual liberty, to the
extent which Americans had surrendered any power
<i>of that kind</i> to their governments, had been so wisely
distributed, between the government of the citizens of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
America and the political entity which was each state,
that it would never be necessary for the citizens of
America to alter that distribution by giving any more
to <i>their</i> government. That is why he prophesied that
no new Article of the kind which only “conventions”
of those citizens can make, Articles changing the “mass
of powers” granted to that government by the First
Article, would ever be needed.</p>

<p>And we recall that this conviction probably influenced
the last day remembrance in the Philadelphia
Convention by Madison and himself, that the Fifth
Article should also contain some reference to the state
legislatures and their future exercise of their existing
abilities to make <i>federal</i> or declaratory Articles, which
do not change the “mass of powers” in that First Article
grant and do not relate to government interference
with the individual liberty of the American
citizen.</p>

<p>The statement of Hamilton was not meant as a
prophecy. It was the result of a great mind reasoning
from cause to probable effect. As we come down
through the century or more that follows that statement
and reach the beginning of the year 1917, we
pay our tribute to a mind which could reason so correctly
<i>as to what would happen for more than a
hundred years</i>. We shall find that never again, from
1787 to 1917, did experience find it necessary that the
“conventions” of the American citizens, the “conventions”
named in the Seventh and the Fifth Articles,
should again be assembled to alter, as they alone can
alter, the mass of enumerated powers to interfere with
their own individual liberty, which they granted in that
First Article.</p>

<p>It is a striking commentary upon the ability of Hamilton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
and his generation, when contrasted with our
modern “constitutional thinkers,” that he knew and
appreciated <i>what would happen in a century to come</i>,
while they have not understood what <i>had</i> happened in
a century that had gone, although the record of that
century was spread out before them to read. None
of <i>our</i> leaders <i>have</i> appreciated the fact that every one
of the first seventeen Amendments to our Constitution
<i>was of the kind</i> that state legislatures had ability to
make before our Constitution was even drafted at
Philadelphia, because all were <i>federal</i> (or declaratory)
Articles and were not <i>national</i> Articles. If they
had known, <i>after</i> these seventeen Amendments were
history, what he prophesied <i>before</i> the Constitution
itself was adopted, the story of the last five years
might not have been what we shall learn hereafter that
it was.</p>

<p>That <i>we</i> may know, <i>of our knowledge</i>, what <i>he</i>
prophesied and what <i>they</i> entirely overlooked and
ignored, let us briefly examine the nature of those
seventeen Amendments. Thus we will learn why governments,
known at Philadelphia in 1787 to be incompetent
to make <i>national</i> Articles, could and did make
those seventeen Articles in the <i>constitutional</i> mode of
procedure which the Fifth Article provided for the
exercise of their existing ability limited to the making
of <i>federal</i> or declaratory Articles.</p>

<p>The first ten Amendments were declarations insisted
upon by the American citizens, assembled in
“conventions” where we have sat, as specific security
against government usurpation of power over their
individual freedom. The Supreme Court has repeatedly
declared that everything in those ten Amendments
was in the Constitution when it was ratified by those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
“conventions” and that the Amendments simply declared
what the will of the people themselves, assembled
in those “conventions,” had already established
as the fundamental law in America. Certainly no man
would challenge the prophecy of Hamilton on the
theory that any one of those Amendments added to the
mass of government powers to interfere with human
freedom. They are, each and every one of them, the
declaration that government cannot do “this” and
government cannot do “that.” So far from being
<i>national</i> Articles, the kind which only “conventions” of
American citizens could or can make, the kind which
tell government that it can command the American
citizens on this or that subject, they are all Articles
which tell government that it <i>cannot</i> command the
American citizen. And, for the further security of
the individual freedom of the American citizen, <i>a
security never needed more than in this year</i> 1923, the
Tenth Declaration emphatically declares <i>who</i> it is that
<span class="allsmcap">RETAINS</span> the <i>exclusive</i> ability to alter, in one iota, “the
mass of powers” (over the individual freedom of the
American citizen) granted <i>by them</i> in the First Article
and the exclusive ability to exercise any power <i>of that
kind</i> over them, which was not granted in the First
Article. Who can deny that, stated in our own words,
this is what we find in the plain declaration of the
Tenth Amendment? “We, the people of America,
assembled in our conventions, have granted to the
<i>American</i> government enumerated powers of the First
Article. They are the only powers <i>of that kind</i> delegated
to any government, by which it can interfere with
our individual freedom in our capacity as American
citizens. All powers, which the citizens of each state
have hitherto had and which we have not taken from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
them herein, we have left with them; and the citizens
of each state can grant so much of said powers as they
please to their own government to govern them as
citizens of that state. All other powers, outside those
we have granted to our government to interfere with
us and those we have left to the citizens of each state
for their own respective exercise, we reserve exclusively
to ourselves, in our capacity as citizens of America.
And, if any government should deem it wise that any
one of these powers (which we so reserve exclusively to
ourselves) should be exercised, we have provided in
the Fifth Article the mode of procedure in which we,
assembled in our conventions, can <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONALLY</span>
exercise it or grant it to the government which wants
to exercise it.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The powers the people have given to the General Government
are named in the Constitution, and all not there
named, either expressly or by implication, are reserved to
the people and can be exercised only by them, or upon
further grant from them. (Justice Brewer in Turner v.
Williams, 194 <i>U. S.</i> 279.)</p>
</div>

<p>Later herein we Americans, fresh from the “conventions”
which demanded these declarations for the
better protection of individual liberty, are going to
hear expounded a doctrine, which would mean that
these declarations were themselves the <i>American</i>
Magna Charta. We are going to hear, to our amazement,
that these declarations were a compact between
an omnipotent government and its subjects, ourselves,
who have always imagined that we were “citizens” and
not “subjects.” We are going to hear, to our utter
incredulity, that these declarations are the promise of a
government—itself omnipotent over ourselves and <i>our</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
Constitution and <i>our</i> government which we thought to
be the supreme government in America—that we, the
subjects of that omnipotent government, may have
certain privileges which this omnipotent government
will not take from us.</p>

<p>When first we shall hear this 1917 resurrection of
the Tory concept that government is master and
Americans are “subjects,” that government is the state
and we are its assets, we shall naturally be astounded
and indignant that even a few inhabitants should still
retain what Madison called “the impious doctrine” of
the Old World, that people are made for governments,
not governments for the people. Quickly, however,
we shall become alarmed to find how wide-spread,
among the “constitutional thinkers” of our own generation,
is the complacent acceptance of the Tory
concept and to learn that, when its application in any
given instance injures a client of one of those constitutional
thinkers, no matter how he may argue against
the application in the particular instance, he neither
knows nor uses for his client the fact that the Statute
of ’76 repealed the doctrine on which Magna Charta
rested, the Tory concept that government is the state
and that we are its “subjects.”</p>

<p>It will be difficult for us to understand these leaders
of our generation. In addition to what we have just
lived through with the early Americans, these leaders
will have before them countless decisions of the Supreme
Court, flatly contradicting the Tory concept on
which all these leaders reason. “The concessions of
Magna Charta were wrung from the King as guarantees
against the oppressions and usurpations of his
prerogatives.... The omnipotence of Parliament
over the common law was absolute, even against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
common right and reason. The actual and practical
security for English liberty against legislative tyranny
was the power of a free public opinion represented by
the Commons.” We are going to find many of <i>our</i>
leaders with the fixed Tory concept that there is in
America a legislative government, unknown to the
generation of Americans who created all government
in America, and that this omnipotent government can
do whatever it pleases, without any constitutional restraint,
with <i>almost</i> everything in America, including
ourselves and our Constitution and our American government.
Curiously enough, we are going to be told
that the one thing, in which this omnipotent legislative
government falls short of absolute omnipotence, has
nothing to do with any individual human freedom, but
is its inability to change the equal representation of
every state in our Senate. It will be quite amazing to
us to hear these men, not <i>proving</i> this Tory concept
but stating it as axiomatic American law and on it
basing their every argument and audaciously claiming
that our Supreme Court has no right even to consider
whether it is so or not. But there will be something
to alarm us even more. We will find <i>our</i> other “constitutional
thinkers,” by circumstances obliged to challenge
some particular deduction from this Tory concept,
without any knowledge of the invincible facts
which challenge the concept itself. To most of these
men it will be as if the Statute of ’76 had been repealed
and the result of our Revolution reversed, in
1787, by the very “conventions” in which we have sat.
It will be our amazement to hear that these “conventions”
never created the citizen of America but that
the American people, assembled therein, voluntarily
made themselves “subjects” of the omnipotent government.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
And these modern “constitutional thinkers”
will discuss this omnipotent government on the basis
that those “conventions” made that particular government
(not the one to whom the First Article grants its
powers) attorney in fact for the general people of
America, authorized to interfere with their individual
freedom, “on all matters whatsoever.” To most of
these men, it will be as if the Supreme Court, in countless
ways, had <i>not</i> declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In this country, written constitutions were deemed <i>essential</i>
to protect the rights and liberties of the people
against the encroachment of power delegated to their governments,
and the provisions of Magna Charta were incorporated
into bills of rights.... Applied in England
only as guards against executive usurpation and tyranny,
here they have become bulwarks against arbitrary legislation;
but in that application, as it would be incongruous
to measure and restrict them by the ancient customary
English Law, they must be held to guarantee, not particular
<i>forms of procedure</i>, but the very substance of individual
rights to life, liberty and property.</p>
</div>

<p>Of course, fresh from the conventions of old, we
shall know that these men are talking nonsense. We
shall know that the last two quoted statements from
the Supreme Court, in Hurtado v. California, 110 <i>U. S.</i>
516, are but the expression of what was once the common
knowledge of a people then “better acquainted
with the science of government than any other people
in the world.” But, as our knowledge shall be as the
knowledge of the Americans of old, who fought an
eight year war of sacrifice to make any such Tory concept
in America absolute nonsense, it is well for us,
while we are examining the nature of the first seventeen
Amendments of our Constitution, to keep in mind one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
thing, which we now know and which, if it had not been
forgotten, would have prevented the monumental
blunder of the generation in which we ourselves are the
American citizens. This one thing is the fact that the
Constitution, made in the conventions we have just
left, is a <i>federal</i> and a <i>national</i> Constitution. That
fact and its influence upon the Convention, which
framed the Fifth Article, and on the “conventions” of
the American citizens, which made that Article, led
them to provide, in their Fifth Article, the <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span>
mode in which state governments could
exercise their existing limited abilities to make federal
and declaratory Articles, like all the Articles of 1781
and like the first seventeen Amendments, <i>and also</i> to
provide therein the <i>constitutional</i> mode in which the
“conventions” of the American citizens could exercise
their exclusive ability to make <span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> Articles, like
the First Article and the supposed new Eighteenth
Amendment.</p>

<p>Having fixed this clearly in our mind, we now proceed
to examine the nature of the remaining Amendments
that were made, prior to 1917.</p>

<p>The Eleventh Amendment gave no power of any
kind to anyone. It simply declared that the Court of
the American nation could not have jurisdiction of
law suits against one of the states “by citizens of another
state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign
state.” We commend, however, to the modern “constitutional
thinkers,” whose Tory concept we shall
meet later, this early American recognition of the fact
that, in America, <i>we are “citizens.”</i> It will be noticed
that this Eleventh Amendment, declared by the President
to have become part of the Constitution on
January 8, 1798, speaks of the “citizens” or “subjects”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
of any foreign state but speaks only of “<i>citizens</i>”
in America.</p>

<p>The Twelfth Amendment likewise has naught to do
with power of governments over human liberty. It
deals solely with the manner in which the Chief
Executive of America shall be chosen.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
are the famous so called Slavery Amendments.
Even the modern “constitutional thinker” of 1917 and
1920, no matter how Tory his concept, will hardly
dare to claim that these Amendments give government
power to interfere with the rights which the Creator
gave to the human being.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the most casual examination of the language of these
Amendments, no one can fail to be impressed with the one
pervading purpose found in them all, lying at the foundation
of each, and without which none of them would have
been even suggested; we mean the <i>freedom</i> of the slave
race, the security and firm establishment of that <i>freedom</i>,
and the protection of the newly-made <i>freeman</i> and <i>citizen</i>
from the oppressions of those who had formerly exercised
unlimited dominion over him. (Slaughter House cases,
Supreme Court, 16 <i>Wall.</i> 36 at p. 71.)</p>
</div>

<p>Of these Amendments, in the Civil Rights Cases,
109 <i>U. S.</i> 3, the Supreme Court again said that “they
abolished slavery, and established <i>universal freedom</i>.”</p>

<p>When, therefore, in the year 1920, we shall hear
these Amendments, which establish <i>universal freedom</i>,
cited as Articles of exactly the same nature as a supposed
new Article, directly interfering with the freedom
of the American citizen on a matter not enumerated
in the First Article, we shall be rather surprised.
But we shall be more than surprised, when we hear
the reason of the modern “constitutional thinker” why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
<i>both</i> Articles are within the power of the state governments,
who are his clients, to put into our Constitution.
Not knowing that our Constitution is a <i>federal</i> as well
as a <i>national</i> Constitution, not knowing that his government
clients always had the ability to make <i>federal</i>
Articles and never had and have not now the ability
to make Articles which interfere with human freedom,
we shall find him stating, as axiomatic, that the slavery
Amendments, which <i>establish</i> universal freedom, and
the supposed Article of 1917, which <i>interferes with</i>
freedom of the individual, are identical, for the reason
that both affect the individual and his rights and
liberties. On the remarkable nature of this identity,
that one <i>secures</i> and the other <i>interferes with</i> individual
<i>liberty</i> and, therefore, both <i>affect</i> individual
liberty, we shall find that he bases the Tory concept
that state governments can do as they please with all
liberties of the American citizens. While his theory will
serve only to amuse us, we commend, to his reading,
this extract from a better <i>American</i> lawyer:—“The
legislature may not confer powers by law inconsistent
with the rights, safety, and liberties of the people, because
no consent to do this can be implied, but they may
pass limitations <i>in favor</i> of the essential rights of the
people.” (Woods appeal, 75 <i>Pa.</i> 59.)</p>

<p>The Sixteenth Amendment simply removes, from
one of the great powers granted to Congress by the
citizens of America in their First Article, a <i>federal</i>
limitation upon its exercise, a limitation entirely for
the benefit of the states which are political entities.</p>

<p>In the “conventions” we have just left, the First
Article grant of power to the new government to impose
direct taxation was the object of incessant attack.
No prerogative of government is more cherished by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
any government than its ability to exact financial
tribute from human beings by means of taxation.
Under the old federation of states, although the
<i>federal</i> government needed money, it was without any
power of taxation. All it could do was to ask the various
state governments to supply it with the money. Article
VII of the “Articles of Confederation” provided
that the expenses of the federal government “shall be
defrayed out of a common treasury, which shall be supplied
by the several states, in proportion to the value
of all land, within each state, granted to or surveyed
for any person, as such land, and the buildings and
improvements thereon, shall be estimated, according to
such mode as the United States in Congress assembled
shall, from time to time, direct and appoint. The
taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and
levied by the authority and direction of the legislatures
of the several states, etc.”</p>

<p>Section 8 of the First Article of the proposed new
Constitution read that “The Congress shall have
power to lay and collect taxes, duties, etc.” At Philadelphia,
in 1787, a tremendous fight was made against
the proposal of this grant by the citizens of America
to their government. Many delegates at Philadelphia,
who had the financial welfare of their particular state
government at heart, contended that, if the new government
were given the power of direct taxation of the
people, the new government would leave the people
with no money to be collected by the state governments
for their own purposes. The <i>nationalists</i> at Philadelphia,
however, knew that a <i>national</i> government
without power of direct taxation over its own citizens
would be a helpless government. Therefore, they insisted
that the proposed grant of this power remain in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
the First Article. As a concession to the opposition
made on behalf of the state governments, there was
added to the proposed First Article a purely <i>federal</i>
limitation on the exercise of the <i>national</i> power of
direct taxation. This federal limitation, on behalf of
the states and their governments, read: “No capitation,
or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in proportion
to the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed
to be taken.”</p>

<p>In the conventions of the citizens of America, the
friends of the respective state governments made every
effort to defeat the First Article grant of national
power to impose direct taxation upon the citizens of
America.</p>

<p>In the Virginia convention, from Randolph and
from Henry, arguing respectively for and against the
grant, we get our certain knowledge that the apportionment
limitation on the exercise of the granted
power was a purely federal limitation aimed entirely
to secure to the respective state governments the just
amount of the moneys which could be collected by
taxation from the Americans living in the respective
states.</p>

<p>Randolph argued: “The difficulty of justly apportioning
the taxes among the states, under the present
system, has been complained of; the rule of apportionment
being the value of all lands and improvements
within the states. The inequality between the rich
lands of the James River and the barrens of Massachusetts
has been thought to militate against Virginia.
If taxes could be laid according to the real value,
no inconvenience could follow; but, from a variety of
reasons, this value was very difficult to be ascertained;
and an error in the estimation must necessarily have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
been oppressive to a part of the community. But, in
this new Constitution, there is a more just and equitable
rule fixed—a limitation beyond which they cannot go.
Representatives and taxes go hand in hand; according
to the one will the other be regulated.... At present,
before the population is actually numbered, the
number of representatives is 65. Of this number,
Virginia has a right to send ten; consequently she will
have to pay ten parts out of sixty-five parts of any
sum that may be necessary to be raised by Congress.
This, sir, is the line.” (Randolph, 3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 121.)</p>

<p>As to the granted power of direct taxation, Henry
argued: “We all agree that it is the most important
part of the body politic. If the power of raising
money be necessary for the general government, it is
no less so for the states.... The general government
being paramount to the state legislatures, if the
sheriff is to collect for both—his right hand for Congress,
his left for the state—his right hand being paramount
over the left, his collections will go to Congress.
We shall have the rest. Deficiencies in collections
will always operate against the states....
Congress will have an unlimited, unbounded command
over the soul of this Commonwealth. After satisfying
their uncontrolled demands, what can be left for
the states? Not a sufficiency even to defray the expense
of their internal administration. They must
therefore glide imperceptibly and gradually out of
existence.” (Henry, 3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 148 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>The Sixteenth Amendment merely removed, in one
respect, this <i>federal</i> limitation upon the exercise of
the national power of direct taxation granted by the
First Article. The Amendment read: “The Congress
shall have power to lay and collect taxes on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment
among the several states, and without
regard to any census or enumeration.” This Amendment,
being nothing but a change in the <i>federal</i> aspect
of the Constitution, being a change in the protection
given to each state as a political entity, was an Amendment
which the state legislatures, each acting as attorney
in fact for its own respective state, were entirely
competent to make.</p>

<p>The Seventeenth Amendment has no relation to
human freedom. It merely provided that the state
governments should no longer elect the august Senators
in the American Congress, some of whom we
shall meet later herein.</p>

<p>This last Amendment, prior to 1917, provided that
those Senators should be thereafter elected in our
states by ourselves, the American people. Curiously
enough, it is from the Senate in which they sit that
came the proposal which caused the trouble which is
obliging us to educate ourselves to find our “when”
and “how” between 1907 and 1917 we became “subjects”
instead of keeping our status as citizens of
America.</p>

<p>Early in our education (p. 26) we were informed
that our public statesmen and constitutional thinkers
brought to the year 1917 the false “knowledge” that
legislatures in America, if enough combined, had the
omnipotence over individual freedom, which the early
Americans denied to the British Parliament. Their
false “knowledge” was undoubtedly caused by their
failure to appreciate, if they knew or remembered,
that America is a <i>national</i> union of men while there
is also a subordinate and <i>federal</i> union of states.
Ignoring this simple fact, they also ignored the important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
fact that the Constitution is both <i>national</i> and
<i>federal</i> and contains Articles <i>of both kinds</i>. Blind to
both important facts, they acquired their false “knowledge”
from the fact that the “legislatures,” to whom
they ascribed omnipotence over individual freedom,
had made the first seventeen Amendments.</p>

<p>The fallacy of their deduction is mathematically
demonstrable.</p>

<p>A constitutional Article which gives to government
any power to interfere with individual human freedom
<span class="allsmcap">IS</span> the constitution of government of men. That is
why the First Article <span class="allsmcap">WAS</span> the constitution of the government
of the nation of men. And, in turn, <i>that</i> is
why the legal necessity of having it made by the men
themselves, in their “conventions,” was “felt and acknowledged
by all” Americans.</p>

<p>If one doubts that the First Article <span class="allsmcap">WAS</span> the constitution
of the government of men, test the truth of the
statement in this way. First, assume that the “conventions”
made no Article save the First. Then ask
yourself if the whole American people would not have
constituted their government with its great enumerated
powers to interfere with their individual liberty. In
the second place, make exactly the opposite assumption.
Assume that the “conventions” made all the
Articles from the Second to the Seventh, both inclusive,
<i>but did not make the First Article</i>. Then ask
yourself whether the whole American people would
have constituted any government with a single power
to interfere with their individual freedom.</p>

<p>Let us now apply exactly the same test to each of
the first seventeen Amendments and then to the supposed
Eighteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>Take any one of the first seventeen Amendments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
and assume that anything <i>new</i> which it put into the
Constitution was the entire Constitution. Then ask
yourself whether, if the Constitution consisted solely
of the new matter in the Amendment, there would be
any government of the whole American people with
a single power to interfere with their individual human
liberty. Take <i>all</i> the seventeen Amendments and assume
that any change all of them made was the entire
Constitution. Then ask yourself whether, if any new
matter in the seventeen Amendments composed the
entire Constitution, would there be any government
of the whole American people with a single power
to interfere with their individual human liberty.</p>

<p>Now make the same assumption about the supposed
Eighteenth Amendment. Assume that it is the entire
Constitution and that there are no other Articles.
Immediately it is seen that, if the Eighteenth Amendment
were the entire Constitution, there would be a
government of the whole American people with an
enumerated power to interfere with their individual
human liberty.</p>

<p>Now we see the fallacy of the false “knowledge”
which our statesmen and constitutional thinkers
brought to the year 1917. Now we know the marvelous
foresight of Hamilton when he stated his conviction
that Amendments would relate to “the organization
of the government, not to the mass of its
powers.” None of the seventeen Amendments did
relate “to the mass of its powers” to interfere with
individual human liberty. That is why state legislatures,
representing the federal members of the union
of states, could make the federal or declaratory seventeen
Amendments. The fact that those “legislatures”
in 1787 could make Articles of that kind, as they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
made them in 1781, did not deceive the Americans at
Philadelphia into a false “knowledge” that those
“legislatures” <i>could</i> make the First Article with its
enumerated powers to interfere with the individual
freedom of the members of the nation of men. The
fact that the same “legislatures,” still representing
the members of the subordinate union of states, still
could make declaratory or federal Articles, <i>and had
made seventeen Articles of that kind</i>, not one of which
constituted new government power to interfere with
individual liberty, should not have misled the statesmen
and constitutional thinkers of our generation.</p>

<p>But it did.</p>

</div>


<p>We have now educated ourselves accurately to
know, at the beginning of 1917, what was our
own relation to all governments and what was the relation
of those governments to one another. With
certainty, we know that those relations, at the beginning
of 1917, were exactly what they had been at the
close of 1790. It is amazingly important that we
never forget that particular knowledge, when reading
the story of what has happened since the beginning
of 1917.</p>

<p>With certainty, through our education we know that,
<i>at both times</i>, the following was our own relation to
all governments and the relation of each of them to
the others.</p>

<p>No individual in America was a “subject” of any
government or governments. Each individual was a
“citizen” of the nation which is America. The citizens
of America, as such citizens, had given to their
only government its enumerated powers to interfere
with their individual freedom. Those American citizens
had given these enumerated powers by direct
grant from themselves, in the only manner, in which
they can act effectively on such a subject, by assembling
in their “conventions.” Those American citizens had
made it the imperative law of America that no new
power <i>of that kind</i> (to interfere with their freedom)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
could be created except by the new exercise of their
own ability <i>in the same manner</i>.</p>

<p>The very essence of the wisdom and <i>efficiency</i> of
the manner of the first exercise was that the exercise
was by “<i>conventions</i>” of themselves, chosen by themselves,
<i>after</i> specific grants had been proposed to them
to be made by them. These “conventions,” chosen
from among themselves for the one purpose of saying
“Yes” or “No” to the proposed grants, had made
those grants in the only way in which the American
people “can act safely, effectively and wisely” in the
making of such grants. In their Fifth Article, made
in the first “convention” exercise, they had mentioned
the very “convention” method in which they were then
assembled to make their First Article grants. Thus,
they made that method <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> for future
exercise of their own exclusive power to make grants
<i>of that kind</i>. Thus they had secured their liberty
against any attempt by government to interfere with
their individual freedom, as American citizens, except
in the matters named in the enumerated powers of the
First Article. In this way, they had secured their
liberty, in their capacity of American citizens, against
any attempt by other governments than their only government
at Washington, even in the matters enumerated
in the First Article.</p>

<p>Nearly every individual in America was also a citizen
of a state. In each state, <i>its</i> citizens had vested
the legislative government of the state with limited
powers to interfere with the individual freedom of
those within the jurisdiction of that state. The limitations
upon the power of each state government to
interfere with those within its own jurisdiction were,
firstly, limitations imposed by the citizens of America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
in <i>their</i> Constitution upon the power of each state to
govern itself; secondly, the limitations imposed by the
citizens of each state in their own constitution; and,
thirdly, the limitations imposed by the traditional
American principle that no government, without limit,
can do what it will with the individual freedom of its
citizens. In each state, subject to those limitations,
its own citizens were exclusively competent to determine
the exact quantum of ability which its own legislative
government should have to interfere with the
individual human freedom of those within its jurisdiction.
No government or governments outside each
state could interfere with the individual freedom of
its citizens, <i>as such citizens</i>, in any matter. No outside
government at all, except Congress, could interfere
with their freedom, as human beings, in any matter.
The legislative governments of the other states, either
singly or collectively, on <i>no</i> matter, could either exercise
themselves or give to any government a single
power to interfere with the human beings in each
particular state. The one American government, at
Washington, could only interfere with those human
beings on the matters enumerated in the First Article.
No new ability in that government so to interfere with
them could be granted except by direct grant from the
citizens <i>of America</i> assembled in their “conventions.”
The Fifth Article had been the command of the citizens
of America that only a “Yes” from three fourths
of those “conventions” of <i>themselves</i> should be valid
to add a new power over themselves to those enumerated
in their First Article.</p>

<p>From 1776 to 1917 it had been the <i>obeyed</i> fundamental
law in America that no government could acquire,
from another government or from other governments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
any power to interfere with the individual
freedom of the human beings within its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The human beings in each state were members or
citizens of the nation which is America. They were
also, in each state, the members or citizens of the
nation which is that state. The states were also members
of their own federation, whose <i>federal</i> government
had been continued by the citizens of America.
In its personnel, that <i>federal</i> government was identical
with the <i>national</i> government of those citizens of
America. In the Fifth Article, the citizens of America
had recognized and mentioned the existing ability
of the states, as political entities, to make constitutional
Articles of a <i>federal</i> nature. For that reason,
the Fifth Article had been the command of the citizens
of America that, when the states exercised their limited
ability, a “Yes” from the legislatures of three
fourths of the states should be effective to make a
<i>federal</i> Article.</p>

<p>In the matter of interference with individual human
freedom, so far as experience tells the story, there had
continued from 1776 to 1917 the knowledge of the
legal fact, made basic American law by the Statute of
’76, that no government could get any <i>national</i> power
except by direct grant from its own citizens, and that
no government could exercise any <i>national</i> power over
any but those in its own jurisdiction and then only by
direct grant of that power from its own citizens.</p>

<p>We know that this was the wonderful system of
constitutional government under which Americans had
lived from 1790 to 1917. We know that the Americans,
who were our predecessors in 1787, had prescribed
that system as best calculated to protect their
human liberty and our own from outside aggression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
and from usurpation of power by their governments
and our own. Educated with them, from the day when
they were all subjects of a legislative government, we
know much of their struggle to rid themselves forever
of the status of “subject” and to become free men.
In that education, however, we have dwelt but little
so far upon one phase of that struggle. At this point,
it is essential that we educate ourselves briefly but
accurately on that one phase.</p>

<p>Whenever government exists, even government limited
to those powers thought by its citizens necessary
to secure human liberty, the weakness of human nature
makes it certain that the exercise of granted powers
will not always be for the common benefit of the citizens
who grant them. When the government is the
State and human beings are its “subjects,” that weakness
is usually more apparent. As a result, in every
country the rich and powerful largely secure the actual
control of government. That they may entrench themselves
in its control and the exercise of even its lawful
powers, they lavish favors on a class actually large in
number but comparatively constituting a small minority
of the people of the country. For this class, it is
of material advantage that government should be the
State and command the people as its “subjects.” When
a man is born or educated as a member of this minority,
it is beyond the experience of the human race that
his mental attitude should not regard the relation of
“subject” to ruler as the proper relation of human
being to government.</p>

<p>In those earlier days, in whose experience we have
just been educated, the human beings in America, who
had that mental attitude, were distinguished from the
Americans by the name “Tories.” Throughout this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
book it is that mental attitude which we characterize
as “Tory.” It is those who display that mental attitude
whom we call “Tories.”</p>

<p>At the time of our Revolution it is a historical fact
that about one third of our population was Tory in
its mental attitude. Many of the Tories, quite possibly
most of them, were actuated by a sincere and deep
conviction that it was better for every one that human
beings should be subjects. That conviction had been
the basis of nearly all science of government for centuries.
It is really a remarkable fact that our history
should show, from their recorded statements and writings,
so many men in 1787 accurately grasping the
fallacy of that historical doctrine that men were made
for kings or governments.</p>

<p>In our education, we now grasp accurately that the
Americans, who ended forever the status of “subject”
in America, in their Revolution, had not only to contend
with their former omnipotent government but
also with one third of their own population, the Tories.
When that Revolution had succeeded, when the Statute
of ’76 had actually been made the basic law of America,
many Tories, in the natural course of events, became
citizens of the particular state, now a free republic,
in which they lived. When the Convention of 1787
assembled at Philadelphia, when the respective “conventions”
in each state later assembled, many delegates
were men with a known leaning to the Tory
mental attitude. It is not to be understood that, by
reason of this fact, their loyalty to the new institutions
of their country was not sincere. One of the great
liberties secured by those new institutions was the right
of the human being to think and talk as he pleased as
to what is the mode of government best designed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
secure the happiness of men. As a matter of fact,
when those “conventions” assembled, many of our
most prominent Americans of the Revolution had
begun sincerely to doubt whether the American people
had <i>yet</i> learned enough to profit most by their legal
ability now to dictate to all their governments how
much power each government should have. It is the
record of impartial history that the people’s distribution
of all surrendered power of a <i>national</i> kind, the
grant to the new government and reservation to the
old state governments, was dictated by two opposite
factors. The wise and able leaders, whether their
mental attitude was American or Tory, knew that the
general government must get a grant of much power
of that kind, if it were successfully to promote the
welfare of the American people. On the other hand,
they knew with certainty that such grants must be
specified and enumerated and limited, or the American
people would make no grant at all. It was, as it still
is, the basic law of America that grants <i>of that kind</i>
could only be obtained directly from the people themselves.
The American mental attitude, that citizens
and not governments shall define the extent of government
power to interfere with individual freedom,
was the controlling factor when the Constitution made
its great distribution of all surrendered powers.</p>

<p>If we go back to the “conventions” of those who
established the system, we find a striking fact. In
those “conventions” there were many men whose personal
opinion always had been and still was in full
accord with the Tory concept of what <i>ought</i> to be the
relation of government to human being. But these
men, with that Tory concept of what government
ought to be, were just as keenly aware as were those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
with the American concept, that the Tory concept had
forever disappeared from American law. Whenever
any suggestion was based upon the Tory concept, these
very men were among the quickest to perceive and the
most strenuous to insist that the suggestion could not
be met because the American concept had displaced
the Tory concept forever in America. If our modern
leaders, who have the same Tory concept of what
government <i>ought</i> to be, had evinced the same perception
and the same insistence, the story of the last
five years would be a different story. Because these
leaders have had no knowledge of what America is,
we average Americans must now come straight from
the “conventions” in which the Americans established
the Constitution to secure individual freedom and we
must educate ourselves in the story of the last five
years in which our governments and our leaders have
calmly assumed that citizens are subjects.</p>

</div>


<p>In the closing month of 1917, the American people
had been for eight months participants in the
World War. In that winter, under the direction of
their only government, exercising its war power, they
were marshalling all that they had to win that war
and to win it quickly. The mind of the people themselves
was concentrated on that one purpose. The
response of the average American citizen to the call
of his government, the assembling of millions of average
American citizens as soldiers for that war, the
outpouring of their money by other millions, should
have made it impossible that the government servant
of those American citizens should have entirely forgotten
and ignored the knowledge of the “conventions”
of 1787, that the American is a citizen and not
a subject. Even if their personal experience had made
them members of the class which naturally have the
Tory mental attitude, the spirit of 1917 should have
awakened our legislators from their wrong Tory concept
of our American basic law. If plain words were
needed to teach them that basic law, only ten years
earlier the Supreme Court had stated that law in words
which even a child can understand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The powers the people have given to the general government
are named in the Constitution, and all not there
named ... are reserved to the people and can be exercised
<i>only by them</i>, or upon further grant <i>from them</i>.
(Justice Brewer, in the Supreme Court, 1907, Turner v.
Williams, 194 <i>U. S.</i> 279.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>Yet the statesmen of America, when its citizens were
offering their lives and their all, chose that December
of 1917 to propose that legislative governments, which
have never been the governments of the American citizen,
should exercise one of those reserved powers of
“the people” and should give to <i>the</i> legislative government
of the American citizens future ability to
exercise that same power, although American citizens
had expressly reserved the power to themselves exclusively.</p>

<p>In December, 1917, as in January, 1790, the American
Congress was the only legislative government of
the American people.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All powers <i>of a national character</i> which are not delegated
to the national government by the Constitution are
reserved to the <i>people</i> of the United States. (Justice
Brewer, in the Supreme Court, Kansas v. Colorado, 206
<i>U. S.</i> 46 at p. 90.)</p>
</div>

<p>Outside of <i>that</i> legislature, American citizens have
<i>no</i> legislative government.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Its powers are limited in number, but not in degree.
Within the scope of its powers, as enumerated and defined,
it is supreme and above the states; but beyond, it has no existence.
(Justice Waite, in the Supreme Court, United
States v. Cruikshank, 92 <i>U. S.</i> 542.)</p>
</div>

<p>In the Senate, on April 4, 1917, Senator Sheppard
of Texas had introduced a Resolution, known as Senate
Joint Resolution 17. The Resolution itself, apart
from the proposed new constitutional Article which
the senator suggested that legislative governments
should make, read as follows: “<i>Resolved by the Senate
and House of Representatives of the United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
of America in Congress assembled (two thirds of each
House concurring therein), That</i> the following amendment
to the Constitution be, and hereby is, proposed
to the States, to become valid as a part of the Constitution
when ratified by the legislatures of the several
States as provided by the Constitution:”</p>

<p>The proposed new national Article, which this 1917
Resolution suggested should be made by legislative
<i>governments</i>, originally and in April, 1917, read as
follows:</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Article—.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Section</span> 1. The manufacture, sale, or transportation
of intoxicating liquors within, the importation
thereof into, and the exportation thereof from the
United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction
thereof for beverage purposes are hereby prohibited,</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Section</span> 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce
this article by appropriate legislation, and nothing
in this article shall deprive the several States of their
power to enact and enforce laws prohibiting the traffic
in intoxicating liquors.”</p>
</div>
<p>By reason of <i>our</i> education in the actual constitution
of our only American government and our respective
state governments, we grasp immediately the
startling nature of the suggestion that the state governments
make that Section 1 and that Section 2. We
first dwell with amazement upon the proposed Section
1 and its proposed makers.</p>

<p>It is a general and direct command to all human
beings anywhere in America, directly interfering with
their individual freedom, on a matter not enumerated
in the First Article. Since we denied omnipotence to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
Parliament, no legislature or legislatures had ever
dared to make any general command to the American
people, except the American Congress and <i>it</i> only since
1789 and on matters enumerated in the First Article.
From 1776 to 1789, no legislature or legislatures had
any power whatever to make a general command to
Americans on any subject whatever. When Americans,
in answer to the Philadelphia 1787 proposal,
made themselves a nation and constituted its government,
they gave to that government <i>enumerated</i>
powers to make general commands on <i>some</i> subjects.
All other power to make general commands <i>of that
kind</i> they withheld from every government and reserved
exclusively to themselves, as they had denied
<i>every</i> power of that kind to every government in the
world by their Statute of ’76. For which very clear
reasons, it had been continually repeated in the Supreme
Court for a century that only one government in the
world could make a general command to the citizens
of America, and that the Congress itself could not
make any such command on any subject not enumerated
in the First Article.</p>

<p>The Congress <i>proposal</i> of the Eighteenth Amendment
was its own recognition of the truth that the sole
government of American citizens had no power to
command them on that subject. It is probable that
nothing ever originated in Congress more remarkable
than this proposal that, because Congress itself was
without the power to make the command, Congress
should ask inferior governments of other citizens to
make a command to the American citizens. If it were
possible that this could be done, there would be no
American citizen. While no public leader or renowned
lawyer has known this simple fact, the story of five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
years has shown how difficult it is to educate <i>the average
citizen</i> away from the “American” mental attitude
of 1776. In 1922, our Chief Executive commented
on the fact that the disobedience of American citizens
to the command made by the state governments had
become a public scandal. From 1765 on, similar disobedience
of Americans to commands made by government
without authority <i>from</i> Americans was a public
scandal to Tories in America and in the British
Parliament.</p>

<p>There can be no mistake about the Tory mental
attitude of the supposed American government which
asked the governments of <i>state</i> citizens to make the
1918 command to the American citizens, interfering
with their individual liberty on a matter outside the
First Article. The request was a frank avowal of
the Tory concept that the people are “subjects” and
that government can constitute new government of
men “in all matters whatsoever.” Even in choosing
the time for the proposal and the command, there was
sincere and flattering imitation of a Tory precedent
of Revolutionary days. When Americans of New York
were away from their homes and at the battlefields
of the Revolution, it was a Tory who stirred up the
House of the Six Nations to make a home attack upon
what was cherished by those Americans. And it cannot
be ignored that it was in 1918, when millions of
Americans were away from their homes either fighting
or prepared to fight for human liberty, the Houses
of forty-five distinct nations were stirred up to make
a home attack upon what those Americans cherished,
their individual freedom. And the analogy does not
end with this fact. Whenever the Tory concept of
the relation of government to “subject” has prevailed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
government has never recognized any obligation of
government to obey law made by government. In the
years which followed 1918, this was strikingly exemplified
by the sole American government which had
asked the governments of <i>state</i> citizens to make a command
to the citizens of America. The command, in
simple English, forbade that certain things be done
in “the United States and all territory subject to the
jurisdiction thereof.” The American government insisted
that its citizens must obey the command. But
the American government itself frankly added that,
on its own ships which flew the American flag, it would
not pay the slightest attention to the command. And
not until this frank Tory attitude had been given unenviable
notoriety did the American government ask
the remarkable information from its Attorney General
whether ships, owned by the American government
and flying the American flag, constituted “territory
subject to the jurisdiction” of America. Then, while
the chief champion of the new Article before the Court
of 1920 and his associate government officials waited
for the information from their associate Attorney General,
the American government continued to act on the
claimed assumption that its ships were not “territory
subject to the jurisdiction” of America. Facts speak
for themselves. It seems impossible to question the
consistent Tory attitude of the American government
in every matter relating to the supposed Eighteenth
Amendment.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the second section of this amazing
new Article, as such second section was originally
suggested by the Senator from Texas.</p>

<p>In its <i>then</i> form it was the suggestion that, after or
simultaneously with the state government exercise of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
an imaginary power to command the American citizens,
those same state governments should vest in the
only government of American citizens a future ability
to make commands on the same subject, a subject not
enumerated in the First Article. The Statute of ’76,
the reasoning and the decision at Philadelphia in 1787
that <i>its</i> First Article could only be made by the “conventions,”
the clear and explicit statements in the Supreme
Court (from Marshall to Brewer in 1907) that
no valid grant of <i>national</i> power could ever be made
except by the “conventions,” the prescription in the
Fifth Article of the <i>constitutional</i> mode in which a
“Yes” from three fourths of those conventions would
validly make grants of <i>such</i> power—all these things
meant nothing whatever to the Senator from Texas
or his colleagues in Congress, to the legislators in the
various states, to government officials or to the “constitutional”
lawyers who have discussed the Eighteenth
Amendment. None of them realized the clear fact
that, if government could get new power over human
beings <i>from government</i>, the Americans, through
whose education <i>we</i> have lived, had wholly failed to
achieve their one purpose, security of human freedom
from any interference by government except under
some power of interference directly granted by themselves
to that government.</p>

<p>Many of the colleagues of the Senator from Texas
questioned the <i>wisdom</i> of asking the grant on that
subject. We know not one, however, who questioned
the <i>ability</i> of the proposed donors <i>to make</i> the grant.
We know not one who questioned as a fact that a
fractional part of our state governments have the very
omnipotence over the individual people of all America,
which those earlier Americans denied to the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
Parliament. Among <i>our</i> “constitutional” lawyers,
there were many who were engaged to combat in court
the validity of the new Article. They questioned its
validity on the ground that it took from the states,
which are mere political entities, part of the power
which each state had not surrendered. In this, they
ignored the legal fact, settled by innumerable decisions,
that the people of America, not the states, made the
Constitution and all its grants of <i>national</i> power.
They questioned its validity on the ground that the
power (to make constitutional Articles) “granted”
(?) in the Fifth Article did not include the power to
make fundamental changes in the Constitution. In
this, they wholly ignored the certain fact that no such
power <i>is</i> granted in the Fifth Article but that two
distinct powers, then existing, one limited and the other
unlimited, are <i>mentioned and not granted</i> in the Fifth
Article, and a mode of procedure for the future exercise
of each is prescribed. In all their challenges to
the validity of the new Article, however, we know not
one who ever knew or mentioned the only and the invincible
challenge to that validity, that new power to
interfere with the individual freedom of the American
citizen could <i>only</i> be obtained <i>constitutionally</i> by direct
action of the American people themselves, assembled
in the “conventions” of the Fifth Article. It meant
nothing to them that the Fifth Article prescribed that
<i>such</i> grants should be valid <i>only</i> when there had been
a “Yes” evoked from three fourths of those conventions.
If we would realize the amazing ignorance,
during the last five years, shown on these matters, we
must continue the tale of the proposed new Article.</p>

<p>Before the proposed Article had left the Senate for
the first time, what we now call Section 2 read, “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
Congress shall have power to enforce this Article by
appropriate legislation.” With the section in that
language, the Joint Resolution was passed and sent to
the House of Representatives on August 1, 1917.
(<i>Congressional Record</i>, Vol. 55, p. 5666.) It was
reported out of the Judiciary Committee and taken up
by the House on December 17, with the proposed
Section 2 reading, “The Congress and the several
states shall have concurrent power to enforce this Article
by appropriate legislation.”</p>

<p>Somewhat educated with those Americans whose
experience made them better acquainted with the science
of government than any other people in the
world, we realize that only Mark Twain could do full
justice to the nature of <i>this</i> alteration to the proposed
Section 2. It was not enough that Congress, because
it did not have the power to make a certain command
to its own citizens, should ask inferior governments,
which are not the government of the American citizens,
to make that command. It was not enough that the
American Congress, when asking these inferior governments
to make that command, should ask them to
give Congress a future ability to make commands on
that subject on which the citizens of America had never
given any government or governments ability to make
any commands to the citizens of America. The House
alteration in the second suggestion from the Senate
would indicate that the House became jealous of the
Senate ignorance of fundamentals in the relations of
governments to one another in America and in the relation
of all governments in America to the individual
American. It is difficult otherwise to explain the
House alteration in the Section 2 of the Amendment
which came from the Senate. As the House reported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
the two sections back to the Senate, this is what the
two sections proposed. Section 1 embodied a command
(to be made by the inferior state legislatures)
which directly interferes with the individual freedom
of the American citizens on a subject not enumerated
in their First Article. Section 2 embodied a grant of
future ability to make similar commands on the same
subject, and the grant was to be from the state legislatures
to the Congress and <i>to the very state legislatures</i>
who were supposed to make the grant itself and
the command of the First Section.</p>

<p>This is exactly the form in which the Second Section
of the supposed new Amendment was later ratified by
these very state legislatures. That Second Section has
been the subject of unlimited discussion for the past
five years. Every one seems to have given it whatever
meaning pleased him at some particular moment.
When the House Chairman of the Judiciary Committee
reported this Section to the House he frankly stated
that “We thought it wise to give both the Congress
and the several states concurrent power to enforce this
Article and let that power be set forth and granted in
the Article we propose to submit.” (<i>Congressional
Record</i>, Vol. 56, p. 424.) But when Wheeler, counsel
for a political organization which dictated that governments
constitute this new government of men, wrote
his briefs to uphold the validity of the new Article
which Webb championed in the House, he explained
that this Webb Second Section “does not add to the
power already conferred upon Congress by Section 1”
but that “it does, however, make clear that the power
is <i>reserved</i> to the states to pass legislation in aid of
the acts of Congress.” As in most matters, the various
champions of the supposed Eighteenth Amendment are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
unable to understand and agree upon the meaning of
plain English. From time to time, in our education,
it will be clear that they do not know and understand
what the American people did in 1788 in their “conventions”
but that, while flatly contradicting one another,
they are all satisfied that the American citizens
did give the state legislatures unlimited ability to interfere
with individual freedom of the American citizen.
It seems natural, therefore, to find Webb and
Wheeler flatly contradicting one another as to the
plain meaning of Section 2 of the Eighteenth Amendment.
Despite the absurdity of the concept, Section 2
means exactly what Webb stated it to mean when he
brought it from the House Judiciary Committee which
had written it. It means, in the plainest English, that
the state legislatures grant to themselves (as well as
to Congress) ability to make commands of the very
same kind as the same state legislatures make, without
the grant, in the First Section. And it is a remarkable
fact that, in all the comment on that Section 2 for five
years, no word has been spoken about this ridiculous
proposal that the state legislatures make a certain
command and then grant themselves the power to
make such commands. However, the absence of such
comment has been quite in keeping with the fact that
our modern leaders and lawyers, during the same five
years, have never known or commented upon the fact
that the Eighteenth Amendment depends for its existence
upon the similar and equally absurd concept
that the Fifth Article is a grant from the “conventions”
to the “conventions” as well as to the state legislatures.</p>

<p>By reason of <i>our</i> education, we have many natural
questions to ask about that Section 2 and the unique
House addition to its supposed grant. While some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
of those questions may be academic, inasmuch as we
know that the new Article is not in the Constitution,
the thoughts which suggest the questions are strikingly
pertinent to our general query, “Citizen or Subject?”</p>

<p><i>In the first place</i>, we recall the opening words of
Section 4 of the Fourth Article of the Constitution.
Those words are, “The United States shall guarantee
to every State in this Union a Republican Form of
Government.” These words immediately precede the
Fifth Article. Moreover, the Supreme Court has decided
that it is the particular duty of Congress to see
that this particular guarantee of the Fourth Article
is strictly fulfilled. (Luther v. Borden, 7 <i>How.</i> 1;
Pacific Telephone Company v. Oregon, 223 <i>U.S.</i>
118.) In the light of these facts, we wish to know
whether the Congress, which proposed the change in
Section 2, so that state governments outside a particular
state might give to the state government of
that state new power to interfere with <i>its</i> citizens,
understood that the Fifth Article was meant to enable
Congress to originate any desired breach of the guarantee
in the Fourth Article. From our education, we
know that, so long as any state has a republican form
of government, its legislature can have no power to
interfere with the individual freedom of the citizens
of a state except by the grant <i>and continued consent</i>
of those citizens themselves. We know that the citizens
of each state, in 1776, gave its legislature power
to interfere with their freedom in the matter which
is the subject of the Eighteenth Amendment. We
know that, then or at any time since then and now, the
citizens of each state could take back <i>that</i> power so
given. But, if the governments of thirty-six states outside
any given state, by the Second Section of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
Eighteenth Amendment, have granted the legislature
of that particular state a new and second power to
interfere with the individual freedom of the citizens
of that state, in the matter which is the subject of the
Eighteenth Amendment, what has become of the republican
form of government in that state? No republican
form of government ever exists where governments,
outside a state, give to its legislature any power
to interfere with the individual freedom of its citizens.</p>

<p>The case of Rhode Island or Connecticut makes our
point clear, although the question is equally apt for
<i>any</i> state, <i>if</i> the Eighteenth Amendment is in the Constitution.
Neither the American citizens in Rhode
Island nor the legislature of Rhode Island, which
speaks only for <i>its</i> citizens and not for any citizens of
America, have ever said “Yes” to the grant to the
legislature of Rhode Island of this new power to interfere
with the individual human freedom of the citizens
of Rhode Island. The other power to interfere with
that freedom, on the same subject, which the citizens
of Rhode Island gave to <i>their</i> legislature, is a power
which the citizens of Rhode Island can take back from
that legislature at any time. But, <i>if</i> the Eighteenth
Amendment is in the Constitution, the legislature of
Rhode Island has a power to interfere with the citizens
of Rhode Island in the exercise of their human freedom,
which power has been granted by governments
<i>outside</i> of Rhode Island, and which power cannot be
taken away from that legislature by the citizens of
Rhode Island.</p>

<p>We average Americans again ask whether the Congress,
chosen to fulfill the guarantee of the Fourth
Article, understood the meaning of the Fifth Article<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
to be that it could suggest and originate any desired
breach of that guarantee?</p>

<p><i>In the second place</i>, we would like to ask another
question of the Congress which proposed that Second
Section and of all who uphold the validity and the
sanity of the Eighteenth Amendment. This other
question is about the two distinct powers, in relation
to Prohibition, which the legislature of every state
must have, <i>if</i> the Amendment is in the Constitution?
The question is simple. When such legislature passes
an act like the Mullan-Gage Law in New York, <i>who</i>
determines which of the two distinct powers the state
legislature exercises? Is it the power granted by the
citizens of that state and revocable by them? Or is
it the power granted by <i>governments</i> outside that
state, over which the citizens of that state have not
the slightest control? The query is a pertinent one.
It is not beyond reasonable assumption that the citizens
of New York may amend their state constitution
and forbid their legislature to enact any statutes interfering
with the freedom of the citizens of New York,
in any way, on the matter which is the subject of the
Eighteenth Amendment. Such a step on the part of
the citizens of New York would be absolutely valid.
It is not forbidden even by the remarkable Eighteenth
Amendment. Such a step would immediately deprive
the legislature of the State of New York of any power
from New York citizens to pass such law. Moreover,
it would end that Law itself, <i>if</i> that Law was passed
in the exercise of the power, in such matters, granted by
the citizens of New York. If it were determined, however,
that the Mullan-Gage Law had been passed by
the New York legislature in the exercise of power delegated
to it by governments outside of New York, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
Mullan-Gage Law would still remain a valid statute.
This would mean, of course, that the republican form
of government guaranteed to the citizens of New
York, by the Fourth Article, had come absolutely to
an end. Our particular query, at this point, is obviously
one of considerable importance to us American
citizens, each of whom happens to be also a citizen of
some state to which the citizens of America made the
guarantee of the Fourth Article and imposed on the
very Congress, which originated the Eighteenth
Amendment, the duty of having that guarantee fulfilled.</p>

<p>There are other equally pertinent questions which
we might ask about this unique Section 2 of the
Eighteenth Amendment. We will leave them for the
present, so that we may continue the story of the travel
of the proposed new Article through the two Houses
of the Congress which suggested that governments
exercise and give government ability to exercise this
new power over American citizens, not enumerated in
the First Article. We come now to the days on which
the House of Representatives and the Senate discussed
the Joint Resolution. In the recorded eloquence of the
advocates of the proposal, we shall find much to remind
us of the prevailing attitude in the British Parliament
toward us in 1775. But, in that eloquence, we
shall look in vain for any echo of the Philadelphia of
1787 or of the “conventions” in which Americans once
assembled and gave their only government its only
enumerated powers to interfere with their individual
freedom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br><span class="small">THE TORY IN THE HOUSE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Let facts be submitted to a candid world.” <i>They</i>
have “combined with others to subject us to a
jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution and unacknowledged
by our laws; giving” <i>their</i> “assent to their acts
of pretended legislation;. .. For. .. declaring
themselves invested with power to legislate for us
in all cases whatsoever.”</p>

<p>It is doubtful if our Congress of 1917 ever read the
above language. It is certain that such Congress, reading
those words, would heed them just as little as all
advocates of the supposed Eighteenth Amendment
have heeded the express commands of the Americans
who uttered those words.</p>

<p>For the information of those who think that governments
in America <i>can</i> validly make grants of
<i>national</i> power, like those in the First Article and the
Eighteenth Amendment, we state that the quoted
words are from the complaint of the American people
against their British Government on July 4, 1776. For
their information, we also state that, on that famous
July day, all Americans ceased forever to be “subjects”
of any government or governments in the world. For
their information, we also state that it will require
more than a combination of our American government
and the state governments to subject us American citizens
to a jurisdiction foreign to <i>our</i> Constitution and
unacknowledged by our laws, the jurisdiction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
state governments, none of which has aught to do with
the citizens of America.</p>

<p>It is a known legal fact, decisively settled in the
Supreme Court, that the jurisdiction of the American
government over the American citizen and the jurisdiction
of the state government over the state citizen
are as distinct and foreign to each other as if the two
citizens were two human beings and the territory of
the state were outside of America.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have in our political system a government of the
United States and a government of each of the several
states. Each one of these governments is distinct from the
other and has citizens of its own who owe it allegiance and
whose rights, within its jurisdiction, it must protect. The
same person may be, at the same time, a citizen of the
United States and a citizen of a state, but his rights of
citizenship under one of these governments will be different
from those he has under the other. (Justice Waite in
United States v. Cruikshank, 92 <i>U. S.</i> 542.)</p>

<p>The two governments in each state stand in their respective
spheres of action, in the same independent relation
to each other, except in one particular, that they would if
their authority embraced distinct territory. That particular
consists in the supremacy of the authority of the
United States where any conflict arises between the two
governments. (Justice Field in Tarble’s Case, 13 <i>Wall.</i>
397.)</p>
</div>

<p>In our Constitution all power ever granted to interfere
with the individual freedom of American citizens
is vested in <i>our</i> only legislature, the Congress. That is
the opening statement of that Constitution in its First
Article, which enumerates all powers <i>of that kind</i> ever
validly granted to that legislature.</p>

<p>In <i>our</i> Constitution no power whatever over the
citizens of America was ever granted to the states<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
singly or collectively, or to the governments of the
states singly or collectively. That all governments in
America, including the Congress of 1917, might know
that settled fact, it was stated with the utmost clarity
in the Tenth Amendment to that Constitution. That
Amendment, repeatedly held by the Supreme Court
to be part of the original Constitution, is the clear
declaration that no power of any kind over us, the
citizens of America, is granted in that Constitution to
any government save the government of America, and
to it only the enumerated powers <i>of that kind</i> in the
First Article. It is also the clear declaration that all
powers to interfere with individual freedom, except the
powers <i>granted</i> in the First Article to the <i>American</i>
government and powers <i>reserved</i> to the citizens of
each state respectively, to govern themselves, are reserved
to the American citizens.</p>

<p>Wherefore, now educated in the experience of the
Americans who insisted on that declaration, we make
exactly the same charge, against the Congress of 1917
and all advocates of the Eighteenth Amendment, that
was made by those Americans against their king who
insisted that they were “subjects” of an omnipotent
legislature.</p>

<p>In December, 1917, the Congress knew that it could
not make, to the citizens of America, the command
which is Section 1 of the Eighteenth Amendment. By
reason of that knowledge, that legislature—the only
<i>American</i> one—paid its tribute to the state legislative
governments as collectively a supreme American Parliament
with exactly the same omnipotence over all
Americans “as subjects” which the Americans of 1776
denied to the British Parliament.</p>

<p>Congress ought to have known that no government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
except Congress can make any command on any subject
to American citizens. It did know that Congress could
not make the command of the new article to the American
citizen. Therefore it paid its tribute to the state
governments. It asked them, as competent grantors,
to give it a new enumerated power to interfere with
the individual freedom of the American citizen.</p>

<p>It is history that those state governments, each with
no jurisdiction whatever except over the citizens of its
own state, went through the farce of signing the requested
grant in the name of the citizens of America.
It is law that those state governments are not the
attorneys in fact of the citizens in America for any
purpose whatever. It is law that no governments
have any power of attorney from the citizens of
America to grant to any government a new enumerated
ability to interfere with the individual freedom of the
American citizens. For which simple legal reason, the
supposed grant of such a power, by government to
government, in Section 2 of the Eighteenth Amendment,
is a forgery.</p>

<p>The supposed Volstead Act was enacted under this
grant. It has met with the severest criticism. No one,
however, has yet pointed out one particular fact to the
careful thought of every average citizen of America.
There are thousands of laws, interfering with individual
freedom, in the statute books of the American
nation and of the respective states. In one respect,
however, this Volstead Act is absolutely unique among
statutes in America. It is the one law in America
<i>of that kind</i>, the kind interfering with individual freedom,
which does not even pretend to be founded on a
grant of authority directly from its citizens to the government
which passed it. It is the only law in America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
directly interfering with human freedom, which was
enacted under a grant of power made <i>by</i> government
to government. It does not detract from this unique
distinction that the American government requested
the grant, and the state governments made it, and the
American government acted under it, by passing the
Volstead Act, all being carefully planned and accomplished
while millions of Americans were preparing to
give and thousands of them did give their lives for the
avowed purpose of securing human liberty from the
oppression of government.</p>

<p>When, in 1787, Americans at Philadelphia had
worded our Constitution, Gerry, opening the short discussion
of its Fifth Article, made this important and
accurate statement of fact: “This constitution is to be
paramount to the state constitutions.” All American
citizens know that each state legislature is the creature
of its state constitution and absolutely subject to that
constitution. We thus have clearly established that
the American Constitution is paramount to all the state
constitutions and that each state constitution is respectively
paramount to the state legislature which it creates
and controls. It remained for the Congress of 1917
and all advocates of the Eighteenth Amendment to
acquire and state and act upon the remarkable “knowledge”
that those same state legislatures are paramount
to everything in America, including the American Constitution,
which is paramount to the state constitutions
which created these very legislatures. That such was
the unique knowledge of the Congress of 1917 is made
clear by its request to those state governments to make
the command of Section 1 to the citizens of America
and to make the grant of Section 2 of power over the
citizens of America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>“We thought it wise to give both the Congress and
the several states concurrent power to enforce this
Article and let that power be set forth and granted in
the Article we propose to submit.”</p>

<p>So spoke Congressman Webb, introducing the proposed
Eighteenth Amendment, exactly as it now reads,
to the House of Representatives, on December 17,
1917. This was the day on which that House discussed
and passed the Senate Joint Resolution 17,
which proposed that Amendment and submitted it to
<i>governments</i> to make it. Webb was a lawyer of renown
and chairman of the Judiciary Committee and had entire
charge of the passage of the Resolution in the
House on behalf of those who had ordered the American
Congress to pass that Resolution.</p>

<p>From one instance alone, we may immediately glean
how clearly Webb and all leading supporters of the
Eighteenth Amendment, in and out of Congress during
the past five years, have shown an accurate “knowledge”
of the basic principles of all government in
America. We realize that such knowledge, if human
liberty is to remain secure, is an essential qualification
of leaders of a people once “better acquainted with the
science of government than any other people in the
world.”</p>

<p>No sooner had Webb read the Section 2 and made
his quoted statement of its purpose than he was asked
a pertinent and important question. The query was
whether, if Congress and a state government each
passed a law and they flatly conflicted, which law
would control? Webb had made long preparation to
carry out his purpose that the Eighteenth Amendment
be inserted in the Constitution <i>by government</i>. He
was prepared with his immediate response to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
ignorant question. His prompt answer was: “The
one getting jurisdiction first, because both powers
would be supreme and one supreme power would have
no right to take the case away from another supreme
power.” (<i>Congressional Record</i>, Vol. 56, p. 424.)
It is sad to relate that this lucid explanation of the
manner in which <i>two</i> distinct supreme powers dictate
to one “subject,” the American citizen, elicited the
next query, “Does the gentleman say that as a lawyer?”
With the charity that real intelligence displays
to ignorance, Webb again explained the simple proposition
of two distinct <i>and supreme</i> powers to command
on exactly the same matter. We commend Webb’s
American mental attitude, without the slightest Tory
taint, and his mastery of American law, to all who ever
wish to dictate to human beings as “subjects.”</p>

<p>Fresh from our education in the experience of the
earlier real Americans, we deem it proper to dwell for
a moment further on that opening statement of Webb:
“We thought it wise to give both the Congress and the
several states concurrent power to enforce this Article
and let that power be set forth and granted in the
Article we propose to submit” to the state governments.</p>

<p>We recall vividly the statement of Lloyd George
made only last year in the British Legislature. He
was speaking of the proposed treaty with Ireland, then
before that Legislature, and this is what he said, in
substance. “The Parliament at Westminster [legislative
government, not the people of the British
Empire] is the source of every power in the British
Empire.” It is our just tribute to Webb and every
American who believes that the Eighteenth Amendment
is in the Constitution, that they understand that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
the American nation is founded and exists on exactly
the same principle. They have all acted upon the one
conviction that the state governments collectively are
exactly the same as the Parliament at Westminster,
are above the American Constitution and need obey no
command in it, and are the legitimate source of any
power to interfere with the individual freedom of the
American citizen, on any matter whatsoever.</p>

<p>On our part, probably blinded by our own education
with the earlier Americans, we still believe that Webb
and all who think with him are hopelessly ignorant of
American law. We believe that they do not understand
in the least the vital change in the status of the
American individual, from “subject” to “citizen,” on
July 4, 1776.</p>

<p>We remember Marshall’s clear statement, in the
Supreme Court, that, in the days when Americans
“were better acquainted with the science of government
than any other people in the world” and the First
Article grants of power over them were requested, the
legal “necessity of deriving those powers from <i>them</i>
was felt and acknowledged by all.” We know that
<i>they</i> made no change in the imperative nature of that
necessity. We do not understand how that legal necessity,
during the past five years, has not been known
to Webb and those of his Tory faith.</p>

<p>We remember Marshall’s equally clear statement,
again in the Supreme Court, that, when new grants of
such power are wanted from its citizens by the American
government, there is only one way, in which those
grants can be validly or “effectively” made, namely,
by those citizens themselves, assembled in their “conventions.”
It is true, the American citizens assembled
in those conventions in their several states. “No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
political dreamer was ever wild enough to think of
breaking down the lines which separate the states, and
of compounding the American people into one common
mass” and of compelling them to assemble in <i>one</i> “convention,”
when it is necessary for them to act, as
possessors of exclusive ability to vest national power
over them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of consequence, when they act, they act in their states.
But the measures <i>they</i> adopt do not, on that account, cease
to be measures <i>of the people themselves</i>, or become the
measures of the state governments. (M’Culloch v. Maryland,
4 <i>Wheat.</i> 316.)</p>
</div>

<p>We do not understand how Webb and those of his
Tory faith have forgotten this legal fact, possibly the
most important in America to the liberty of its citizens.</p>

<p>We remember how well this legal fact was once
known to all Americans, how clearly the Americans in
Virginia expressed it as the then knowledge of all
Americans and their leaders. “The powers granted
under the proposed Constitution are the gift of the
people, and every power not granted thereby remains
with them, and at their will.” (Resolution of the
Americans in Virginia, ratifying the Constitution and
making the grants of its First Article, 3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i>
653.) We do not understand how Webb and those of
his Tory faith, speaking the language of Lord North
in 1775 and of Lloyd George in 1922 as to the British
Government of “subjects,” should translate the quoted
accurate statement of American law into, “The powers
granted under the proposed Constitution are the gift of
the people, but every power not granted therein remains
with the collective state legislative governments
and can be granted by those governments, without any
action by the citizens of America themselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>We know that the Supreme Court, in 1907, did not
so understand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The powers the people have given to the General Government
are named in the Constitution, [all in the First
Article] and all not there named, either expressly or by
implication, are reserved <i>to the people</i> and can be exercised
only by <i>them</i>, or upon <i>further grant</i> from <i>them</i>. (Justice
Brewer in Turner v. Williams, 194 <i>U. S.</i> 279.)</p>
</div>

<p>We do not understand how Webb and those of his
Tory faith could believe that one of those reserved
powers could be exercised by the collective state governments,
Section 1 of the new Amendment, or could
be granted by those governments, Section 2.</p>

<p>We remember that Madison, who worded the Fifth
Article, and Hamilton, who seconded it at Philadelphia,
did not so believe but knew that such belief
came in direct conflict with basic American law. “As
the people are the only legitimate fountain of power,
and it is from them that the constitutional charter,
under which the several branches of government hold
their power, is derived, it seems strictly consonant to
the republican theory, to recur to <i>the same original
authority</i> [the people themselves in “conventions”]
whenever it may be necessary to enlarge, diminish, or
new-model the powers of the government.” (Hamilton
in <i>The Federalist</i>, No. 49.) “The fabric of
American Empire ought to rest on the solid basis of
the <i>consent of the people</i>. The streams of <i>national</i>
power ought to flow <i>immediately</i> from that pure,
original fountain of all legitimate authority.” (Hamilton
in <i>The Federalist</i>, No. 22.) “The express
authority of the people alone could give due validity
to the Constitution.” (Madison in <i>The Federalist</i>, No.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
43.) “It is indispensable that the new Constitution
should be ratified in the most unexceptionable form,
by the supreme authority of the people themselves.”
(Madison, at Philadelphia, 5 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 158.) “The
genius of republican liberty seems to demand on one
side, not only that all power should be derived from
the people, etc.” (Madison in <i>The Federalist</i>, No.
37.) and “There is certainly great force in this reasoning,
and it must be allowed to prove that a constitutional
road to the decision of the people ought to be
marked out and kept open, for certain great and
extraordinary occasions.” (Madison or Hamilton in
<i>The Federalist</i>, No. 49.)</p>

<p>We average Americans know that, in the Fifth
Article, there is “marked out and kept open, for certain
great and extraordinary occasions a <i>constitutional</i> road
to the decision of the <i>people</i>” when their own exclusive
ability is alone competent to do what is deemed wise to
be done. We know that the direct command to American
citizens, interfering with their individual freedom
and contained in Section 1 of the new Amendment, was
the first direct command <i>of that kind</i> ever attempted to
be put in our Constitution. We know that the grant
of power to make such commands, which is the grant
of the second section of that Amendment, is the first
and only grant <i>of that kind</i> ever supposedly made since
1788. Knowing these undoubted facts, we cannot understand
why Webb and those of his Tory faith did
not know that the request for the command of Section
1 and for the grant of Section 2 was “a great and
extraordinary” event, and that only through the “<i>constitutional</i>
road for the decision of the <i>people</i>” themselves,
“marked and kept open” in the Fifth Article,
the assembling of the people themselves in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
“conventions,” could a valid command and a valid
grant be achieved.</p>

<p>The more we average Americans consider, however,
the Congressional record of 1917 and the story of the
subsequent five years, the more do we understand the
curious mental attitude which has led Webb and those
of his Tory faith, who believe that the new Amendment
is in the Constitution, to think that governments
could make that command to and that grant of power
over the citizens of America. Our consideration leads
us to think that none of these men have ever read or
grasped the meaning of the words expressing a knowledge
so often shown by our Supreme Court:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The people who adopted the Constitution knew that in
the nature of things they could not foresee all the questions
which might arise in the future, all the circumstances
which might call for the exercise of further <i>national</i> powers
than those granted to the United States, and after making
provision for an Amendment to the Constitution by which
any needed additional powers would be granted, they reserved
to <i>themselves</i> all powers not so delegated. (Justice
Brewer, Kansas v. Colorado, 206, <i>U. S.</i> 46 at p. 90.)</p>
</div>

<p>We are sorely afraid that Webb and the Congress
of 1917 and all upholders of the new Amendment have
made exactly the same vital mistake which had been
made, in that reported case, by the counsel who there
represented the very same government which repeated
the mistake in 1917.</p>

<p>That counsel had contended for the proposition that
there are “legislative powers affecting the nation as a
whole [the citizens of America] which belong to, although
not expressed in the grant of powers” in the
First Article. The answer of the Supreme Court was
decisive on the mistake of that counsel and the mistake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
of the 1917 request from Congress to the state governments.
The answer was that the proposition</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>is in direct conflict with the doctrine that this is a government
of enumerated powers. That this is such a government
clearly appears from the Constitution, independently
of the Amendments, for otherwise there would be an
instrument granting certain specified things made operative
to grant other and distinct things. This natural construction
of the original body of the Constitution is made absolutely
certain by the Tenth Amendment. This Amendment,
which was seemingly adopted with prescience of just
such contention as the present, disclosed the wide-spread
fear that the National Government might, under the pressure
of a supposed general welfare, attempt to exercise
powers <i>which had not been granted</i>. With equal determination
the framers intended that no such assumption
should ever find justification in the organic act, and that if
in the future further powers seemed necessary, they should
be granted <i>by the people</i> in the manner they had provided
for amending that act. It reads: “The powers not delegated
to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited
by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people.” <i>The argument of counsel ignores the
principal factor in this Article</i>, to wit, “<span class="allsmcap">THE PEOPLE</span>.” Its
principal purpose was not a distribution of power between
the United States and the States, but a reservation <i>to the
people</i> of all powers <i>not</i> granted. The preamble of the
Constitution declares who framed it,—“We, the people of
the United States,” not the people of one State, but the
people of all the States; and Article X reserves to the
people of all the States the powers not delegated to the
United States. The powers affecting the internal affairs
of the States not granted to the United States by the Constitution,
nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to
the <i>States respectively</i>, and all powers of a national character
which are not delegated to the National Government
by the Constitution are reserved to the <i>people of the United
States</i>. (206 <i>U. S.</i> at p. 89.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>We average Americans know, and Webb and those
of his Tory faith cannot deny, that the power to make
the command of Section 1, the power purported to be
granted in Section 2, are among the powers of which
the Supreme Court speaks as reserved, not to the
states, but to the people of America. We also know,
and again <i>they</i> cannot deny, that only those, who have,
can give, or grant. For which reason, <i>we</i> ask that
<i>they</i> answer this question: How can the state governments
exercise or grant a power which was not reserved
to the states but was reserved by the citizens of
America to themselves?</p>

<p>In asking this question we but echo the learned
Pendleton’s question, in the Virginia convention of
1788: “Who but the people can delegate powers?...
What have the state governments to do with
it?” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 37.) And we also but echo the
question of Wilson, in the Pennsylvania convention of
1787: “How comes it, sir, that these state governments
dictate to their superiors—to the majesty of the
people?” (2 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 444.)</p>

<p>But we, the citizens of America, have a further
charge, at this point, to make against Webb and all
who claim that the new Amendment is in the Constitution
or that any governments could put it there. In
the case of Kansas v. Colorado, supra, counsel for the
government of America made a monumental error by
displaying his ignorance of the most important factor
in the Tenth Amendment, “the people” of America.
By reason of that particular ignorance, he assumed that
all power to interfere with the individual freedom of
Americans, on every subject, must be vested in some
government or governments. This was the Tory concept,
accurately rebuked by the supreme judicial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
tribunal, knowing only American law based on the
American concept of the relation of “citizens” to their
servant government and not on the Tory concept of
the relation of the master government to its “subjects.”
He did not know what Cooley knew when he
made his accurate statement that “There never was a
written republican constitution which delegated to
functionaries all the latent powers which lie dormant
in every nation and are boundless in extent and incapable
of definition,” (<i>Constitutional Limitations</i>,
7th Ed., 1903, p. 69.) By reason of his ignorance, he
contended that government could command American
citizens by interfering with their individual freedom
on a matter not enumerated in the First Article. His
particular error, in that respect, is repeated by Webb
and all who uphold the validity of the command made
in Section 1 of the new supposed Amendment.</p>

<p>But they were not content with repeating his one
monumental error. They have not only ignored the
most important factor in the Tenth Amendment, “the
people.” They have also wholly ignored the most
important factor in the Fifth Article, the mention of
the <i>way</i> in which the citizens of America made their
only valid grants of power to interfere with their individual
human freedom, the mention of the only way
in which new grants <i>of power of that kind</i> can ever be
<i>constitutionally</i> made, the assembling of <i>those</i> citizens
in their “conventions” in their several states. So assembled
in such “conventions,” they made all their
grants in the First Article and then, in their Fifth
Article, mentioned their own assembling in exactly
similar conventions in the future and prescribed that
a “Yes” from three fourths of those conventions would
be the only valid signature of the citizens of America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
to any new grant of a further enumerated power to
interfere with their individual freedom.</p>

<p>There never has been any other possible meaning to
those words in the Fifth Article, “or by conventions
in three fourths thereof.” To the Americans who
worded that Article at Philadelphia and to the
Americans who made that Article, assembled in just
such “conventions” as are mentioned in words therein,
that quoted phrase was the most important factor in
the Fifth Article. To them, those quoted words
therein were the complement of their most important
factor in the Tenth Amendment, the reservation to
themselves (“the people” or citizens of America) of
every <i>national</i> power not delegated in the First Article.
Together, the two important factors were the
command of the citizens of America that all <i>national</i>
powers so reserved to themselves could be delegated
only by themselves, assembled in their “conventions”
—“by conventions in three fourths of” their states.
We, who have lived through their education with
them, realize this with certainty. Webb and those who
believe with him know nothing about it.</p>

<p>Recognizing that Congress had been given no power
to make the command which is Section 1 of the new
Amendment, they first asked the state governments
to make that command to the citizens of America. This
was an exact repetition of the error made by counsel
in Kansas v. Colorado, supra. This was their ignoring
of the most important factor in the Tenth Amendment.
Then, that the display of their own ignorance should
contain something original, they ignored the most important
factor in the Fifth Article and requested that
a new power, reserved by the citizens of America to
themselves, should be granted by the state governments.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
Everything that they have said or done, during
the last five years, is based on that ignoring of that
most important factor in that particular Article.</p>

<p>Indeed Webb himself made this very clear at the
very opening of his appeal that Senate Resolution
Number 17 be passed in the House on December 17,
1917. He merely paused to make the lucid explanation
of how <i>two</i> supreme powers act, and then went on
to read the Fifth Article as it appears in his expurgated
edition of our Constitution. This is the Fifth Article
he read to our only legislature:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“that Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall
deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution
... which ... shall be valid to all intents and
purposes as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the
legislatures of three fourths of the several states.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is clear to us, who have followed the framing of
that Article in Philadelphia in 1787, that the Americans
who framed it there and the Americans who made
it, in their later “conventions,” would not recognize
<i>their</i> Fifth Article. In the expurgated edition, the
most important factor in the real Fifth Article is not
only ignored but is entirely missing. It has been
stricken from the Article. We do not know who ordered
that it be stricken out. We recall with interest
that, on September 15, 1787, at Philadelphia, Gerry,
always a consistent Tory in mental attitude, moved
that it be stricken out of the Article. We recall that
his motion was defeated by a vote of 10 to 1. Nevertheless,
when we come to read that Article, as Webb
and his colleagues for the new Amendment know it,
we find that they must have some other record of the
vote on that old September 15, 1787, and of the later
votes in the “conventions” of the citizens of America.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
We find that in the Fifth Article, as Webb and his colleagues
know it, there are no words “by conventions
in three fourths of” the several states. We realize
that this reading of <i>his</i> Fifth Article and the absence
of those important words from it was no mere inadvertence
on the part of Webb. Clearly those words
are not in <i>his</i> Fifth Article. Only a few moments after
his reading of it, on December 17, 1917, he quoted
with approval a statement, by some former Senator,
that the American people have a “right to be heard
in the forum of the state legislatures, where <i>alone</i> the
question can be decided whether the <i>national</i> Constitution
shall be amended.”</p>

<p>In view of these facts, we educated citizens of
America have no difficulty in grasping the Tory mental
attitude of Webb (and his colleagues <i>for</i> the new
Amendment) that all constitutional protection for our
individual freedom may be legally dispensed with at any
time <i>by government</i>, if governments only get together
and act jointly, as in the proposal and supposed adoption
of the new Amendment entirely by governments.
For the edification of Webb and those of his faith in
that respect, we would like to inform them that all who
believe that the new Amendment has been or can be
put in the Constitution by governments, “seem to have
lost sight of the people altogether in their reasonings
on this subject; and to have viewed” our national and
state governments, “not only as mutual rivals and
enemies, but as uncontrolled by any common superior
in their efforts to usurp the authorities of each other.
These gentlemen must be here reminded of their error.
They must be told that the ultimate authority,
wherever the derivative may be found, resides in the
people alone, and that it will not depend merely on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
the comparative ambition or address of the different
governments, whether either, or which of them, will
be able to enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction at the
expense of the other.” (<i>Fed.</i> No. 46.) It contributes
not a little to the importance of the quoted
statements that they were written by Madison, who
also wrote the real Fifth Article. They are his warning
to the then “adversaries of the Constitution.”
They serve well as our warning to the present adversaries
of our Constitution, who assume and have acted
on the assumption that they can ignore its most important
factors whenever government desires to exercise
or to grant a new power to interfere with our
individual freedom, although we have not granted it
but have reserved it to ourselves.</p>

<p>We might continue somewhat indefinitely the story
of Senate Joint Resolution 17 in the House of Representatives
on that December day of its passage therein.
We would find, however, what we have already seen
of Webb and his colleagues there to be typical of all
they have said and all that they knew of basic American
law. We cannot leave that House on that day,
however, without some comment upon the final eloquent
appeal made by Webb at the close of his arduous
labor to secure the passage of the Resolution.</p>

<p>To those, who have any knowledge in the matter, it
is well known that Christ preached the doctrine of free
will and temperance, while Mohammed laid down the
law of prohibition. With great curiosity, therefore,
we have listened for years and still listen to the ceaseless
tirade coming from Christian churches where men
style themselves American “Crusaders” and denounce,
in no temperate language, all Americans who do not
align themselves under the “Crescent” flag of Mohammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
and respect his Mohammedan command
embodied in the First Section of the Eighteenth
Amendment. Our curiosity is not lessened by the fact
that their denunciation of those, who flatly deny that
the command itself is Christian, is always accompanied
with an equally temperate denunciation of those who
dare to question their Tory concept that governments
in America can constitute new government of men.</p>

<p>We have seen Webb, with a candor only equalled
by ignorance, frankly array himself with those who
believe the Tory concept, that the legislatures of the
state citizens are “the only tribunal” in which the
<i>national</i> part of the Constitution of the American citizens
can be changed. To his credit, therefore, we find
it a matter of record that, with equal candor, he
frankly arrays himself under the “Crescent” flag of
Mohammed and eloquently appeals to all other devotees
“of the great Mohammed” in support of the
Mohammedan and un-Christian precept embodied in
the Eighteenth Amendment. That full justice may be
done his eloquence and his candor, these are his own
words on his immortal December 17, 1917: “During
one of the great battles fought by Mohammed, the
flag was shot from the ramparts. A daring and devoted
soldier immediately seized it with his right hand
and held it back on the rampart. Immediately his
right arm was shot off, but, never faltering, he seized
the flag with his left hand and that, too, was instantly
shot away whereupon with his bleeding stubs he held
the emblem in its place until victory came.</p>

<p>“With a zeal and a determination akin to that which
animated <i>this</i> devotee of the great Mahomet, let us
wage a ceaseless battle and never sheathe our swords
until our constitutional amendment is firmly adopted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
and the white banner of real effective prohibition
proudly floats over every courthouse and city hall
throughout this, the greatest nation upon earth.”
(<i>Congressional Record</i>, Vol. 56, p. 469.)</p>

</div>


<p>When our present Constitution was before the
people of America, waiting their approval or
rejection, Madison and Hamilton published their
series of essays, now known as <i>The Federalist</i>. It is
not our intent to dwell upon the knowledge of American
basic law shown by these two men. Elsewhere
our Supreme Court has paid its deserved tribute to
<i>The Federalist</i> as an authority of the greatest weight
in the meaning of our Constitution. At this moment,
we desire to mention one remarkable quality which
makes those essays unique among arguments written
in the heat of a great political controversy. They were
written to urge that human beings create a great nation
and grant some enumerated powers to interfere with
their own freedom. They were written when other
great leaders were opposing that project with the utmost
ability and eloquence. These opponents, as is
the custom with men in any heated controversy, denounced
the project and its advocates. The abuse of
both project and advocates has probably never been
exceeded in America. Yet it is one remarkable quality
of the arguments of Madison and Hamilton, in <i>The
Federalist</i>, that they themselves never leave the realm
of reason and fact and law, or descend to irrelevant
abuse of those who differ in opinion with them.</p>

<p>We, who have lived through the last five years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
in America, can truthfully say that the advocates of
the new constitution of government, the Eighteenth
Amendment, have made their essays and speeches and
arguments notable for the same quality, by its utter
absence.</p>

<p>Because fact would interfere with the making of
their new Constitution, they have changed fact. Because
law meant that government could not constitute
their government of the people, they have stated law
which has never been law in America since 1776. Because
reason would prevent the achievement of their
purpose, they have appealed to irrelevant abuse of
those who dared to differ in opinion with them.</p>

<p>In view of these known facts, we average Americans
shall not be surprised when we read the record of the
Senate on its own proposal that government should
exercise a power not delegated to interfere with individual
freedom. Fresh from the reading of the record
in the House, we shall not be surprised to find that
the Senate also ignored the most important factors in
the Tenth Amendment and the Fifth Article, “the
people” in the one, and the mention of the people’s
exclusive ability to make <i>national</i> Articles in the other.</p>

<p>When his proposing Resolution came before the
Senate on July 30, 1917, Senator Sheppard quickly
made clear his mental attitude on the relation of government
to human beings. Whenever a sincere Tory
has voiced himself on that matter, it has always been
inevitable that he betray the thought that human beings
are the assets of the State and not its constituent
members. As Madison said, “We have all known the
impious doctrine of the Old World, that people were
made for kings and not kings for the people.” In the
country <i>or in the mind</i> where that doctrine prevails, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
is held to be the right and the privilege of government
to see that the people, like the other assets of the State,
are kept in good condition so that all property of the
State may have its greatest economic value in the
market of the world.</p>

<p>And so we find Sheppard, through all his opening
support of the new constitution of government based
on the Tory doctrine, making clear the necessity that
our government keep that asset, which is the citizens
of America, in good physical condition like any other
machine that may be in America.</p>

<p>“In an age of machinery and of business transactions
on a scale more enormous and complicated than
ever before, the clear eye, the quick brain and the
steady nerve are imperatively demanded. Society today
is more dependent upon the man at the machine
than at any previous period. We are coming to understand
that the engine of the body must have the same
care as the engine of the aeroplane, the battleship, the
railway train, the steamship or the automobile; that
the trade in alcohol is a form of sabotage which the
human machine cannot endure; that it is no more to be
tolerated than would be the business of making and
selling scrap iron to be dropped into the delicate and
complex machinery of modern manufacture, transportation
and commerce.” (<i>Congressional Record</i>, Vol.
55, p. 5550.)</p>

<p>After this admirably accurate appreciation of the
relation of our American government to the asset
which is ourselves, Sheppard then proceeded to teach
us (who have just lived through the education of the
American human beings who made the Constitution)
the real facts of that making, <i>as he knows them</i>.</p>

<p>He is advocating that our only American government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
should ask the legislative governments of the
states, which are not the governments of <i>American</i>
citizens, directly to interfere with our individual freedom
and to grant to themselves and to our only government
future power to interfere therewith on a matter
not enumerated in the First Article. Naturally, as real
fact would make manifest the absurdity of such proposal,
he states that, when the Constitution was made,
“by votes of the Southern States the power to amend
the federal Constitution was vested in three fourths
of the states.” Undoubtedly he meant us to understand
that the Constitution (through whose real making
we have just lived) was made by the states and
that the Southern States granted to the legislatures
of three fourths of the states the omnipotent ability
over the human beings of America, which those human
beings themselves had denied to the English king and
his legislature. That he meant us so to understand
we shall learn to a certainty in a moment. Meanwhile,
let us note how inadvertently he states part of the
truth, while omitting all reference to the part thereof
which would make his own proposal the clear absurdity
which it was.</p>

<p>We note his reference to that part of the Fifth
Article which <i>mentions</i> the ability of three fourths of
the state legislatures to amend the <i>federal</i> Constitution.
Because we have lived through the days of the
real American leaders, we recall that our Constitution
is both <i>federal</i> and <i>national</i> and that state legislatures
always had ability to make <i>federal</i> Articles and never
had ability to make <i>national</i> ones. We also remember
that those state legislatures were permitted, by the
people who made our Constitution, to retain some of
the ability they had and were given no new ability.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
We also remember that the Fifth Article mentions
their existing ability to make <i>federal</i> Articles and prescribes,
as the command of the people of America, that
a “Yes” from three fourths of them shall validly make
a change in the <i>federal</i> part of our dual Constitution.
For which reason, with somewhat of amusement, we
note Sheppard’s inadvertent accuracy of statement,
when he says that three fourths of the state legislatures
may amend the <i>federal</i> Constitution. With our
knowledge, we do not care what he meant or intended
that others should understand. We know that nothing
has been more definitely settled in America, since
1776, than that legislative governments never can
make a <i>national</i> Article or change our <i>national</i> Constitution.</p>

<p>We now come to that part of Sheppard’s oration
in which he makes certain his remarkable “knowledge”
that our Constitution was made by the states—which
are political entities—and not by the people of
America. With a complacency requisite in one who
advocates that unique constitution of a new kind of
government in America, government of the people by
government without authority from the people, we
find him quoting from Calhoun of 1833 the doctrine
that the states made the Constitution. “In this compact
they have stipulated, among other things, that
it may be amended by three fourths of the states; that
is, they have conceded to each other by compact the
right to add new powers or to subtract old, by the
consent of that proportion of the states, without requiring,
as would otherwise have been the case, the
consent of all.” (<i>Congressional Record</i>, Vol. 55, p.
5553.)</p>

<p>The history of America from May 29, 1787, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
July 30, 1917, was clearly a sealed book to Sheppard
of Texas on that later day.</p>

<p>On May 30, 1787, at Philadelphia, Randolph of
Virginia offered the three Resolutions, which proposed
that the people of America create a nation and absorb
into their <i>national</i> system the <i>federal</i> union which had
been made by the states. The first resolution was to
express the sentiment of the convention “that the union
of states merely <i>federal</i> will not accomplish the objects”;
the second was to express the sentiment that
“no treaty or treaties among the whole or part of the
<i>states</i>, as individual sovereignties, would be sufficient”;
and the third was to express the sentiment “that a
<i>national</i> government ought to be established, consisting
of the supreme legislative, executive, and judiciary.”</p>

<p>The work of that Philadelphia Convention was
carried to a successful conclusion on the basis of those
sentiments. When their proposed Constitution had
been worded, it was sent to and made by the one people
of America, <i>not by the states</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Constitution of the United States was ordained
and established, not by the states in their sovereign capacities,
but emphatically, as the Preamble of the Constitution
declares, by the “people of the United States.”</p>
</div>

<p>So declared Justice Story, from the Bench of the
Supreme Court, as far back as the decision of Martin
v. Hunter’s Lessee, 1 <i>Wheat.</i> 324. As Story was an
associate of Marshall on that Supreme Court, and as
he is recognized as one of the greatest exponents of
our Constitution, we average Americans prefer his
knowledge to that of Sheppard even when the latter
does quote from Calhoun. Furthermore, in an unbroken
line of decisions, extending over the entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
period of more than a century of whose history Sheppard
knows naught, the Supreme Court has insistently
proclaimed the same fact, namely, that the people of
America—not the states—made our Constitution.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is no longer open to question that by the Constitution
a nation was brought into being, and that that instrument
was not merely operative to establish a closer union or
league of States.” (Justice Brewer, in the Supreme Court,
Kansas v. Colorado, 206 <i>U. S.</i> 46.)</p>
</div>

<p>Indeed, many men before Sheppard have attempted
to deny that fact. History, however, records no successful
denial. As Sheppard states, the words of
Calhoun were from his reply to Webster in 1833. In
the history of a century, all a sealed book to Sheppard,
Haine also asserted, against Webster, the belief
of Calhoun and Sheppard as to what were the facts
of the making of our Constitution. We average
Americans, in an earlier chapter herein, have read
Webster’s statement as to what were the facts of
that making. Having lived, ourselves, through the
days when the Americans did make their own Constitution,
we agree wholly with Webster and the Supreme
Court and know that the states had no part
whatever in its actual making. Over fifty years ago,
however, it became absolutely immaterial, except for
academic purposes, what might be the personal beliefs
of ourselves or Calhoun or Haine or Sheppard or
Webster. Shortly after the middle of the last century,
the Southern States, just as unwilling as Sheppard
in 1917 to accept the unalterable decision of the
Supreme Court that our Constitution is not a compact
between states, appealed to the only tribunal to which
there is any appeal from that Court, the tribunal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
civil war. Even Sheppard must know the result of
Gettysburg, the surrender forever of any claim that
the Constitution is a compact between the states. Even
Sheppard must some time have heard the echo of
Lincoln’s appeal, at Gettysburg, that government of
the people, by them and for them, should not perish
from the earth. Even Sheppard must recognize,
whether or not he wish to do so, how successfully the
American people, whose predecessors made the Constitution,
answered that appeal of Lincoln and intend
to keep our government a government of the people,
by them and for them, instead of a Sheppard government
of the people, by governments without authority
from the people.</p>

<p>We average Americans, however, do not question
the wisdom of Sheppard in quoting the repudiated
claim of Calhoun, so long as Sheppard and his colleagues
intended to continue their effort to impose
upon us the new constitution of a new kind of American
government, which is their Eighteenth Amendment.
If he and they were to find anywhere citations
in support of the ability of governments in America
to exercise and to grant undelegated power to interfere
with human freedom, to what source could he
or they go for such citations? Their proposition depended
wholly for its validity upon the Tory concept
of the relation of government to its assets and subjects,
the people. And, in the five volumes of the
records of the conventions of the Americans, in the
two volumes of <i>The Federalist</i>, and in over two hundred
volumes of American decisions in the Supreme
Court, he and they knew that no single citation of
authority could be found to support the idea that we
Americans are “subjects” and not citizens. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
face of such a situation, he and they had but a choice
between the repudiated claims of Calhoun and Haine
or the concepts of Lord North and his associates in
the British Parliament of 1775. We average Americans
know what choice we would have made, <i>under
such circumstances</i>. For which reason we are not surprised
to find Sheppard, after his remarkable quotation
from Calhoun, continuing on to say that the
states “by reserving to themselves the unqualified and
exclusive right of amendment kept intact their sovereign
capacity in so far as the organic law of the
nation was concerned.” (<i>Congressional Record</i>, Vol.
55, p. 5553.)</p>

<p>With the Supreme Court, we have always known
and we still know, despite Sheppard, that the people
of America did all the reserving that was done and
which the Tenth Amendment merely declared had been
done. We note, with intent to remember, how clearly
Sheppard demonstrated his total ignorance of the most
important factor in that Tenth Amendment, “the people,”
and of the most important factor in the Fifth
Article, the mention of the reserved exclusive ability
of the people themselves, assembled in their “conventions,”
to amend or change or add any <i>national</i> Article
in their Constitution.</p>

<p>As we go on with his oration of that July day, we
find him insisting, as we found the House insisting
on a later day, that the states and their legislative
governments are all the protection to our individual
liberties which the American people were able to attain
by the efforts of those remarkable years from
1775 to 1790. Curiously enough, that insistence is
mentioned in the same breath in which he suggests
that we, the citizens of America, have some rights,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
evidently in the nature of privileges which a government
confers on its subjects. This is what he has to
say: “In refusing the people the right to appeal to
the only tribunal having power of amending, the tribunal
of the states, for the redress of what they consider
one of the most terrible grievances in the republic,
Congress would deny to them one of the most
sacred of all rights, the right of petition.”</p>

<p>Why should the supreme legislature not deny that
right of petition to us, if the inferior state legislatures,
who are not governments of the citizens of
America, claim power to deny us any right they please,
as they do by their supposed Eighteenth Amendment
to our Constitution?</p>

<p>But we waste time on this Sheppard. Let him say
his own farewell to us; the citizens of America, in his
closing words of July 30, 1917. As Webb, in the
House, closed with his eloquent appeal to every true
Mohammedan, we naturally find Sheppard closing
with his appeal to whatever Tory sentiment believes
that the same most important factor in the Tenth
Amendment and the Fifth Article should be equally
ignored.</p>

<p>“At the close of this debate we will have an opportunity
to enable the states to exercise their highest
function—the right to shape, alter, and develop the
federal Constitution. They are the proper tribunal
to decide the fate of this Amendment. They compose
the mightiest array of free commonwealths united in
a federated whole the world has ever seen.... If
there is anything in the Amendment subversive of
<i>their</i> liberties and <i>their</i> welfare, <i>they</i> can be trusted
to condemn it. Let not Congress assume to judge for
them. Let Congress discharge its preliminary task<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
of submission and stand aside. Let it put in motion
the referendum provided by the national organic law—the
method of amendment the states themselves
established when they created the Constitution. Let
the states perform the duty which remains the sole
instance of their sovereignty over the federal government
itself.” (<i>Congressional Record</i>, Vol. 55, p.
5554.)</p>

<p>If it were still 1833, if there never had been a
Gettysburg or an Appomattox, could Calhoun himself
have done better? If there never had been the Statute
of 1776 or an American Revolution to make it the
basic law of America, could any Tory peer in the
Westminster Parliament of 1775 have been more
zealous to see that the states themselves—which are
mere political entities—should determine whether
there was anything in the Eighteenth Amendment
“subversive of <i>their</i> liberties and <i>their</i> welfare?” If
there is, “<i>they</i> can be trusted to condemn it.” Let <i>our</i>
“Congress discharge its preliminary task of submission
and stand aside.” What if there is anything in the
Amendment subversive of <i>our</i> liberties and <i>our</i> welfare?
Why should <i>we</i> be trusted with the opportunity
to condemn it, the opportunity which we reserved exclusively
to ourselves by the most important factors
in the Tenth Amendment and the Fifth Article?</p>

<p>Why should we remember that Jefferson, also from
a Southern State, penned the Statute of 1776 in which
the American people commanded that no government
acquire power over people except from people and
not from governments? Why should we remember
that Pendleton, also from the South, while actually
engaged with all the rest of the American people in
making the First Article, referred to it and asked, “Who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
but the people can delegate powers? What have the
state governments to do with it?” Why should we remember
that Wilson, in the previous December, that
of 1787, said of our Constitution, “Upon what principle
is it contended that the sovereign powers reside
in the state governments? The proposed system sets
out with a declaration that its existence depends upon
the supreme authority of the people alone? How
comes it, sir, that these state governments dictate to
their superiors—to the majesty of the people?” Why
should we remember that Webster, answering Hayne
and Calhoun, said, also speaking of our Constitution,
“While the people choose to maintain it as it is—while
they are satisfied with it, and refuse to change
it—who has given, or who can give, to the state legislatures
a right to alter it, either by interference, construction,
<span class="allsmcap">OR OTHERWISE</span>?... Sir, the people have
not trusted <i>their</i> safety, in regard to the general constitution,
to these hands. They have required other
security and taken other bonds.” (4 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 508.)</p>

<p>It is true that these earlier Americans have clearly
in mind the most important factor in both the Tenth
Amendment and the Fifth Article. But it must not
be forgotten that Pendleton and Wilson and the
Americans of that day, in making our Constitution,
in constituting a new government and giving to it some
powers over the freedom of human beings, were acting
entirely outside any written law except the Statute
of ’76. Is not their example a sound precedent for
those who are now constituting a new government of
Americans and giving it power over their freedom,
for those who made the Eighteenth Amendment and
those who upheld its validity? What if the makers
of the new government are themselves government?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
If governments choose to act outside of all written
law and to ignore that part thereof which is the important
factor of the Tenth Amendment and the Fifth
Article, are these governments not emulating the example
of the American people in 1787? True, these
American people did act in strict conformity to the
Statute of 1776, and this modern constitution of new
government by government is not in conformity with
that Statute. But was not that Statute itself the revolt
of human beings against government? If human beings,
by successful revolt against government, could
change themselves from subjects to citizens, why cannot
government, by successful revolt against human
beings, change them from citizens to subjects?</p>

<p>If, however, Sheppard and Webb and those of their
Tory faith insist that the new constitution of government
is in <i>our</i> Constitution, and put there validly,
under claimed grant from us to state governments of
omnipotence over American citizens, we, on our part,
know that their claim is without the slightest support.
Moreover, our knowledge in that respect is knowledge
of indisputable legal fact. That the fact would
be equally indisputable, even if our Constitution was
a compact between states, as Calhoun did claim, and
as Sheppard does claim, we can clearly demonstrate
even to Sheppard himself. Our education with the
earlier Americans, who changed their status from that
of subject to citizen, has taught us all we need for
that demonstration.</p>

<p>Let us assume, what Sheppard asserts, that the
states made the Constitution, that it <i>is</i> a compact between
states. Sheppard is a Texan. If our Constitution
is a compact between states, the State of Texas
is one of the parties to that compact. We ask Sheppard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
whether he and the other Texans <i>are</i> the State
of Texas or whether the legislative government in
Texas is the State of Texas? If he answers that the
Texas legislature is the State of Texas, we proceed
no further. That answer will be his frank confession
that the Texan is a subject of the Texas government
and not a citizen or member of the Texas State.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if he answers that the human
beings of Texas are the State of Texas, we do proceed
further. We proceed along the most definitely settled
legal principle in America. If the human beings in
Texas are its citizens and constitute its State, the constitution
of Texas is their creation and the legislature
of Texas is the creature of that constitution. From
the Texans, through the creation which is their constitution,
that legislature derives its every power over
the human beings in Texas and cannot have any <i>such</i>
power except by grant from those human beings themselves.
That is the law of Texas, settled by hundreds
of decisions in Texas and America. Now, if our
American Constitution is a compact between the State
of Texas—the human beings in Texas—and the other
states—the human beings in the other states—how
comes it that the mere creature of the Texans, without
power over them except from them, can, by combination
with other servant legislatures outside Texas,
give to itself and to other governments outside Texas
a new power to interfere with the freedom of the
human beings in Texas?</p>

<p>We are rather afraid that Sheppard and those of
his faith, even assuming that our Constitution is a
compact between states, have entirely overlooked the
legal fact that a government is not the State in America.
We are rather afraid that they have reverted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
to what Madison called “the impious doctrine of the
Old World,” namely, that the government is the State
and the human beings are its asset and its property.
We are rather afraid that they agreed with the concept
of Louis of France, expressed in his famous “I
am the State.”</p>

<p>On no other basis can we explain their complete
ignorance of the one important factor in the Tenth
Amendment and the Fifth Article, “the people” of
America, who, assembled in their “conventions,” as
mentioned in the Fifth Article, are the citizens of
America and compose the State or Nation of America.</p>

<p>We average Americans, in the light of our education,
reading the record of that July 30 in our Senate,
would have thought, <i>were it not for one fact</i>, that
every senator was using the expurgated edition of the
Constitution, which Webb later used in the House,
and which omits entirely from the Fifth Article the
words, “by conventions in three fourths of” the states.
Were it not for that one fact our thought would have
been justified. We know that the proposition of
Sheppard, embodied in his Senate Resolution No. 17,
was that the proposed new Article should be referred
to the tribunal of the state legislative governments.
We know, and we have quoted his own statement,
which is the basis of that knowledge, that he held
that legislative tribunal to be “the only tribunal having
power of amending” our Constitution. We know
that he held this legislative tribunal to be “the proper
tribunal to decide the fate of this Amendment.” We
know his confidence that this legislative and government
tribunal has “the right to shape, alter, and develop”
our Constitution, ordained and established by
the citizens of America. His conviction, in this respect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
is stamped indelibly on our mind, because it
came in such sharp conflict with our knowledge that
<i>all</i> Americans of an earlier day held that every <i>national</i>
Article, like the First Article and the supposed Eighteenth
Amendment, must be referred to that other
tribunal, the only tribunal competent to make <i>such</i>
Articles where men are citizens and not subjects, the
tribunal of the American citizens themselves, the tribunal
mentioned in the Fifth Article in the words “by
conventions in three fourths of” the states in America.</p>

<p>We know, therefore, inasmuch as neither Sheppard
nor any senator but one apparently knew of the existence
of that other and supreme tribunal or of the
presence of those words in the Fifth Article, that all
senators save that one must have been using an expurgated
edition of the Fifth Article.</p>

<p>On that July 30 we find Senator Ashurst making
plain that he has our edition of our Constitution. He
said, “When our federal Constitution was written in
1787, two methods of amending were provided; and,
unless I am mistaken, it was the first written constitution
in history which provides for two methods of
amendment.” This brief and simple mention of that
significant fact, in relation to the Fifth Article, seems
to have been the only cognizance of the fact itself, in
the Senate of that day or in the entire subsequent history
of the Eighteenth Amendment, even in the great
litigations about it in which were arrayed against one
another the most renowned “constitutional” lawyers
in America. So far as would appear from the Senate
record, no knowledge of the amazingly important effect
of that Fifth Article <i>mention</i> of two distinct
powers (one limited and then existing in government
and the other unlimited and then and now existing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
the American people) to make future Articles was
acquired in the Senate or afterward, from the fact
itself or from Ashurst’s allusion to the fact.</p>

<p>Back at Philadelphia in 1787, Gerry, always Tory
in his mental attitude to government and human being,
realized fully the amazing importance of this Fifth
Article mention of the two then existing powers to
make Articles, the limited power of legislative governments
to make <i>federal</i> Articles (which had made
all the federal Articles of 1781) and the unlimited
and <i>exclusive</i> power of the people themselves to make
<i>national</i> Articles, which had been exercised to make
the national Articles in each existing state constitution,
and which the Philadelphia Convention had already
ascertained and held was the <i>only</i> power competent
to make such Articles as their own proposed
First Article and the Eighteenth Amendment. While
the Philadelphia Convention had been discussing and
deciding that their proposed Constitution, because of
its First Article, the real constitution of government,
must be referred to the people, Gerry had always
opposed that decision. He had always fought to
have that First Article sent to government, to have
its grants of power over the freedom of men made
by government to government. When, therefore, the
closing business day of that Convention was reached
on September 15, 1787, he made his final and consistent
Tory effort that citizens should be asked to
make a Fifth Article which would change them back
again to the subjects they had been in 1775. That
effort was his motion of September 15 to strike from
the Fifth Article, as we know it, the words “or by
conventions in three fourths of” the states. He knew,
as we know, by reason of our education with the Americans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
who defeated his effort, that those words are
the Fifth Article <i>mention</i> of the then existing only
ability in America which then could or now can make
such Articles as the original First Article or as the
supposed Eighteenth Amendment. He knew, as we
average Americans now know, that, only <i>if</i> such mention
<i>were</i> stricken from that Fifth Article, could any
future possible claim be made that legislative governments
have ability to exercise or to grant undelegated
power to interfere with individual freedom. With
the important object in mind, that he secure <i>some</i>
foundation for such claim in the future, he made his
motion to strike that mention of our exclusive power
from that Fifth Article. As we average Americans
know, his effort to have a convention even propose
such a Fifth Article to “a people better acquainted
with the science of government than any other people
in the world” was beaten by the decisive vote of 10
to 1.</p>

<p>The proposal of the Eighteenth Amendment by
government to government was the attempt of our
servant American government to reverse the result
of that vote of September 15, 1787. The action of
the state legislative governments in America upon
that proposed Eighteenth Amendment was an action
depending <i>entirely</i> for its validity upon a recount of
that vote and the assumption that the convention did
strike out that mention of our exclusive power to make
national Articles and that the Fifth Article went to
the American people and was made by them <i>without
that mention in it</i>. For which very obvious reasons,
we average Americans do not understand how the
fact, to which Ashurst made brief allusion on July 30,
1917, was not the basis of every attack made in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
Supreme Court by many of the most renowned “constitutional”
lawyers in America, when they did assail
the validity of that Eighteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>It is difficult to pick out the one most remarkable
thing in the complete story of the last five years.
Yet we are inclined to believe that, from a certain
point of view, the one most remarkable thing is the
absolute failure of even one of those renowned lawyers
to appreciate or know or mention the fact and
its <i>decisive</i> effect upon the alleged validity of the
Amendment they challenged, the fact that the Fifth
Article does name two future makers of Articles, the
governments which could and did make the federal
Articles of 1781, but which neither could nor did
make the First Article of 1787 or the Eighteenth
Amendment of 1917, and the citizens of America,
who could and did make the First Article of 1787
and who alone can make but have not made the Eighteenth
Amendment.</p>

<p>Even Ashurst seems to have known that it was
remarkable, unique in history, for the Fifth Article
to name two different makers of future Articles. It
is amazing that the imperative reason for this naming
of two makers, distinct and different in their ability
to make, never suggested itself to any of the renowned
lawyers of 1920, even though they knew the dual
nature, <i>national</i> and <i>federal</i>, of our Constitution. It
is amazing when we realize that the Supreme Court,
in 1819, had stated, as an obvious thing, that, when
the First Article (granting power to interfere with
the freedom of men) was proposed, the legal “necessity
of referring it to the people, and of deriving its
powers <i>directly from them</i>, was felt and acknowledged
by all.” It is amazing when the same Supreme Court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
in 1907 had authoritatively repeated that statement:
“The powers the people have given to the general
government are named in the Constitution, and all
not there named, either expressly or by implication,
are reserved to the people and can be exercised only
by them or upon further grant from them.”</p>

<p>However, we average Americans, still pursuing the
history of America to learn when we again became
“subjects,” will later herein consider the litigation
about the Eighteenth Amendment. So far as the
Senate is concerned, we leave it on December 18,
1917, the day on which it finally proposed that legislative
governments make the Eighteenth Amendment,
whose Second Section was exactly of the same nature
as the First Article, namely, an Article of the kind
which the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 had
known never could be made by legislative governments
in America. In that Senate, as in the House,
the public record discloses no American who did not
ignore the most important factor in the Tenth Amendment
and the Fifth Article, no American who knew
the legal necessity of deriving, directly from the people
themselves, every power to interfere with the individual
freedom of the people.</p>

<p>So far as history tells the tale, in the legislatures
of the states, that legal necessity was “known and acknowledged”
by none. There were many therein, as
there were many in the later court litigations, who
opposed the making on the ground of its unwisdom.
There were also many, again as in the later litigations,
who contended that there should be no interference
with the freedom of American citizens, as such,
except on the matters enumerated in the First Article.
But, neither in our own American legislature nor in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
these state legislatures, as in the later litigations, was
there one who knew the only legal and maintainable
ground for that belief, the legal fact, as the Philadelphia
Convention found it, that only the American
people could validly grant government power to interfere
with their individual freedom, and the legal fact
that the American people, constituting their government,
kept the legal situation, in that respect, exactly
as the Philadelphia Convention found it, by the most
important factors in the Tenth Amendment and the
Fifth Article.</p>

<p>The amazing haste with which the ratifying legislatures
exercised, for the first time in America, this imaginary
power to interfere with the individual freedom
of the American citizens is a matter of history. The
manner in which that legislative exercise of imaginary
government power over subjects was secured in many
states is something with which we are all familiar. We
desire, however, to emulate the example set by Madison
and Hamilton in <i>The Federalist</i>, so far as judgment
can restrain the honest indignation of citizens,
when government undertakes to make them “subjects.”
Therefore we leave it entirely to those who uphold
the validity of the supposed new Amendment to substitute
irrelevant matter, mostly personal abuse that
is harmless in view of its source, for the sound legal
arguments in support of validity, which they can never
find until the Statute of ’76 is repealed and our constitutions
of government are so changed that we cease
to be citizens and become the subjects our ancestors
were in 1775.</p>

<p>For those who would like to look upon all American
governments as model exemplars of American respect
for American law and American constitutions, the date<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
of the proposal in December, 1917, and the quickness
of ratification and the manner in which ratification was
largely secured, are all matters most unpleasant to
contemplate. Even now the most sincere advocate of
the new Amendment never speaks of it without unwittingly
showing his chagrin at the general knowledge
that it <i>was</i> proposed and passed by governments when
millions of the citizens of those governments were
fighting and were armed to fight for human liberty,
and that even governments would never have dared
to pass it except at that particular time.</p>

<p>These facts, however, reflect only on the virtue of
the Amendment. They have no bearing upon its
validity. We average Americans are interested now
only in that claimed validity. We know that, if it is
valid, we have become subjects, that we are no longer
citizens. We are seeking to find out when and how
that change was made in our relation to all governments
in America. Beginning on July 4, 1776, we
have come down to December 18, 1917. We have
found ourselves, on that day, still citizens. We know
that our servant legislature at Washington made a
proposal on that day, which was legally absurd, unless
we had already become subjects. We have listened
carefully to what they had to say, in support of that
proposal, and have ascertained that they neither knew
nor understood the most important factor in our Tenth
Amendment and Fifth Article, by which our ancestors
kept their own and our status as citizens. We
know that the state legislatures could not change that
status. Therefore we now simply note the fact that,
in 1918, some of them ratified the proposal on the
basis that all of us were their subjects. We know
that our own government at Washington has acted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
whenever it felt disposed to enforce the supposed
new command against us and not to disobey it openly
itself, as if we <i>were</i> the subjects of those ratifying
legislatures.</p>

<p>We know also that in 1920, after more than a year
of exhaustive study of our history and our Constitution
and our laws by hundreds of our most eminent
lawyers, all working for one object, the legal demonstration
of the invalidity of the new Amendment, a
chosen number of the most renowned “constitutional”
lawyers in America appeared in the Supreme Court
and orally argued against validity and filed the briefs
against validity which were the result of this concentrated
effort. We know also that, in that court, on
behalf of our own government and on behalf of those
other governments which that government has proclaimed
to be the supreme dictator in America, there
also appeared another chosen array of the most renowned
“constitutional” lawyers, in the forefront being
a former justice of that court, now the American
Secretary of State. This latter array appeared to
demonstrate how and when, since 1790, our own status
was changed from citizen to subject and the collective
legislatures of some of the states were substituted for
ourselves as possessors of the supreme constitutional
will in America.</p>

<p>We average Americans, therefore, to complete our
education, now turn to the arguments of these lawyers
and to their briefs, with somewhat of chagrin at our
own unaided ability to ascertain the “when” and
“how” <i>we</i> became subjects and <i>our</i> Constitution, in its
<i>national</i> Articles and aspect, became the creature of
legislative governments, although the American people
originally created it to be the master of all governments.</p>

<p>“The establishment of a Constitution, in time of
profound peace, by the voluntary consent of a
whole people, is a prodigy.” (<i>Fed.</i> No. 85). Those
were the words of Hamilton, in a final appeal to the
people of America, as they were about to assemble in
their “conventions.”</p>

<p>As he thought it a prodigy that their voluntary
consent should be secured to that constitution of government
contained in the First Article, he frankly
added that he looked forward “with trembling anxiety”
to their own determination as to whether or not
<i>they</i> would give that <i>necessary</i> consent to the enumerated
grants in that First Article. We know how the
patriotic efforts of himself and Madison and his other
colleagues were later rewarded by the giving of that
consent. We know <i>where</i> those average Americans
of that day gave that consent, <i>where</i> they made that
constitution of their <i>national</i> government which is that
First Article. “It is true, they assembled in their
several states—and where else should they have assembled?
No political dreamer was ever wild enough
to think of breaking down the lines which separate
the states, and of compounding the <i>American</i> people
into one common mass. Of consequence, when <i>they</i>
act, they act <i>in</i> their states. But the measures <i>they</i>
adopt do not, on that account, cease to be the measures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
of the people <i>themselves</i>, or become the measures of
the state <i>governments</i>.”</p>

<p>In the many other Supreme Court decisions, telling
the tale of the completion of the “prodigy” and all
stating the same legal fact, is there a more apt and
accurate expression of the knowledge of the American
people, who were better acquainted “with the science
of government than any other people in the world,”
that the “conventions” in the respective states, assembled
to constitute their American government by
grants like those in the First Article and the Eighteenth
Amendment, are the Americans themselves and
that the state <i>governments</i> never are the American
people themselves and never represent <i>those</i> people
for <i>national</i> purposes. It was natural that such apt
and accurate expression of that concept should have
been voiced by Marshall in the Supreme Court. He
had been one of those people, fighting on the battle-field
with them to wrest from all governments in the
world any ability to constitute government by making
grants like those in the First Article or the Eighteenth
Amendment. He had been one of those people in one
of those “conventions,” in their respective states,
where <i>they</i> made the only Article <i>of that kind</i> which
ever entered their and our <i>national</i> American Constitution.
Later it became his privilege and duty (<i>and
our great good fortune</i>) to explain <i>who</i> alone could
make and did make that First Article and <i>who</i> alone
can ever validly make Articles like it or the Eighteenth
Amendment, namely, the American people themselves,
assembled in convention in their respective states.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we read the Fifth Article, made
by him and his fellow Americans in those “conventions,”
we recognize at once and we will never forget<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
or ignore <i>their</i> mention of <i>themselves</i>, in the very word
by which he and they then described <i>themselves</i>, “conventions”
in their respective states.</p>

<p>In making the Eighteenth Amendment grant of
power to interfere with American freedom, we—the
American citizens and “conventions” of this generation—have
been ignored as completely as if we were
not named in the Fifth Article.</p>

<p>We have been trying to ascertain “when” and
“how” the American human beings, now ourselves,
ceased to be “citizens of America” and again became
“subjects” of governments. We have gone to the
record of our Congress on those days in 1917, in
which it acted on the assumption that the “when” and
“how” were already history. We have found no
Senator or Congressman who vouchsafed any information
or displayed any knowledge of this matter, so
vitally important to us who were born citizens and
free men. We have seen the leader of the House
advocates of the new constitution of government, the
Eighteenth Amendment, read a Fifth Article in which
the “conventions” of those who made it and the First
Article are not mentioned. We have seen the leader
of the same advocates in the Senate complacently assert
the repudiated thought that the states made the
First Article, our constitution of <i>our</i> government. We
have seen him follow up this error with the Tory mistake
of assuming that the government of the state is
the state. We have seen him point out, to our American
amazement, the remarkable and hitherto unknown
fact, never mentioned by the people who made
the Fifth Article, that the state governments are the
only tribunal in which our <i>national</i> constitution of
government can be changed, that those governments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
are a tribunal in which new enumerated power can be
given by government to government to interfere with
our own individual freedom.</p>

<p>Fresh from our education with the Americans who
made that Fifth Article in “conventions” of the very
kind mentioned therein, we see that those legislators
of 1917 know naught of American history or law or
constitution of government of men, that from them
we cannot learn “when” or “how” we ceased to be
“citizens” and became “subjects.” But, there assembled
in the Supreme Court in March, 1920, many renowned
“constitutional” lawyers. Some came to challenge,
some to uphold the new Amendment, the new
government-made constitution of government right to
interfere with individual human freedom.</p>

<p>To the reading of all their briefs and arguments we
bring our knowledge that the new Amendment never
entered our Constitution <i>unless</i> we were “subjects”
before 1917 or <i>unless</i> the new Amendment was itself
a revolution (by government against citizens) which
made us “subjects.”</p>

<p>We expect the lawyers <i>against</i> the new Amendment
to challenge its existence with the facts and knowledge
we bring from our education with the Americans who
made themselves free men and citizens.</p>

<p>We expect the lawyers <i>for</i> the new Amendment to
point out the day and the manner in which they claim
that government of the American people by the American
people <i>did</i> disappear from America.</p>

<p>Unless these lawyers for the Amendment do point
out that day and manner and sustain their claim as to
both, we know that the existence of the new Amendment
is successfully challenged by the facts which we
have acquired in our education. Before we listen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
the expositions of these facts by the lawyers against
the new Amendment, let us briefly review the facts
themselves as they bear upon the supposed existence
of the new Amendment.</p>

<p>When 1776 opened, the American people were subjects
in rebellion against their omnipotent government.
By direct action of themselves, in July, 1776, they
made themselves free men, made their former colonies
independent states and made each of themselves a
citizen of some one of those states. Almost immediately,
the Statute of ’76 having declared the actual
fact that the supreme will in America was possessed
by the American people, at <i>their</i> suggestion and with
<i>their</i> permission, the citizens of each state constituted
their own government with its <i>national</i> powers to
interfere with the individual freedom of its own citizens.
In strict conformity to the Statute of ’76 and
to the sole American concept of the relation between
government and human being, those grants of power
to interfere with individual freedom, like every other
grant <i>of that kind</i> until the Eighteenth Amendment,
were made by the respective citizens to their respective
governments.</p>

<p>In 1777 the committee of the American people
known as the Second Continental Congress proposed
a union of states or political entities and a general
government to govern states but not to interfere directly
with the human freedom of the individual. Because
there is a vital distinction between the ability to
govern states and the ability to interfere with individual
freedom, those Americans knew that states or
political entities could make <i>federal</i> Articles but that
only citizens could ever validly make <i>national</i> Articles.
It was impossible for these Americans not to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
this difference between the respective abilities of states
and citizens of America. Their Statute of ’76 had
declared this sole American concept of the law controlling
the relation of government to human being.
They were actually engaged in their Revolutionary
War for the very purpose of making it forever American
law that no governments could ever grant <i>national</i>
power in any matter. Because, therefore, the proposed
Articles of 1777 were only <i>federal</i> Articles with
grants of <i>federal</i> power, it was “felt and acknowledged
by all” that the state legislatures were competent to
make <i>those</i> Articles. So we recall, with intent to remember,
that those <i>federal</i> Articles were made in the
exercise of that legislative government ability to make
<i>federal</i> Articles, which is mentioned in our own Fifth
Article.</p>

<p>In 1787, from the same Philadelphia, there came
the proposal that the American people, collectively
the possessors of the supreme will in America, create
a new nation, with themselves as its members or citizens
and, as its members, constitute its government
with <i>national</i> powers to interfere with their own individual
freedom. Because the legal necessity of deriving
powers <i>of that kind</i> from the people themselves
was “felt and acknowledged by all,” the inevitable
legal decision was reached at Philadelphia that the
existing ability of legislative governments to make
<i>federal</i> Articles neither then did nor ever could include
the ability to make <i>national</i> Articles like the First
Article and the supposed Eighteenth Amendment. By
reason of that legal necessity and its then recognition
by all, because the First Article contained grants of
<i>national</i> power, “by the convention, by Congress, and
by the state legislatures, the instrument was submitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
to the people. They acted upon it in the only manner
in which they can act safely, effectively, and wisely on
such a subject, by assembling in convention.” The
reasoning and the decision itself were embodied in
Article VII and in the Resolution which went from
Philadelphia with the proposed seven Articles, including
the Fifth Article.</p>

<p>As the Supreme Court has definitely settled, the
Tenth Amendment merely declares what was in that
original proposed Constitution. Therefore the Constitution
gave no new government ability anywhere
except to the government at Washington. It gave to
that government only specific ability to govern human
beings, in certain matters. It merely <i>reserved</i> to <i>each</i>
state government some of its former ability to govern
its own citizens. It gave neither to any state government
nor to all state governments collectively any new
ability to govern. And it reserved to the American
people themselves all ability to exercise or to grant
any <i>national</i> power to interfere with the freedom of
American citizens except those enumerated powers in
the First Article. The Supreme Court has definitely
settled that this reservation of such power exclusively
to themselves, by the makers of the Fifth Article, is
the most important factor in our constitutional distribution
of that kind of power among our American
government, our state governments and, most important
of all, ourselves, the citizens of America. For
which reason, until this generation, it has always been
axiomatic that the mention of that exclusive ability of
our own, “conventions” of <i>Americans</i> in their respective
states, is the most important factor in the Fifth
Article.</p>

<p>In strict conformity with the Statute of ’76 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
without usurping the reserved powers of the most important
factor in both the Tenth Amendment and the
Fifth Article, seventeen <i>federal</i> changes were made,
between 1789 and 1917, in the <i>federal</i> part of our
Constitution, which is both a <i>federal</i> and a <i>national</i>
Constitution. The situation in 1917 was exactly the
same as it had been since July 4, 1776, when it was
known even to the humble townsmen of Concord that
governments could not make <i>national</i> Articles in American
constitutions. Or rather, the situation in 1917
was the same <i>unless</i>, somewhere prior to 1917, the
Statute of ’76 had been repealed and the most important
factor in both Articles had been eliminated from
the Fifth Article and Tenth Amendment of the American
Constitution, which is the security of the American
citizen against usurpation of power even by governments
in America.</p>

<p>We know that Gerry moved to strike that important
factor from the Fifth Article in September, 1789,
and that he failed in his effort. We know that Webb
and the legislative advocates of the new Eighteenth
Amendment had a Fifth Article in which that most
important factor was not present. Apparently they
based their government proposal and government ratification
of the Eighteenth Amendment upon a Fifth
Article which did not contain that most important
factor, the reference of the makers of the Fifth Article
to themselves as the makers of all future Articles
of a <i>national</i> kind, the reference of those makers to
themselves in the words “conventions” of the American
people, assembled in their respective states.</p>

<p>Keeping all these settled facts clearly in our minds,
we now take up the arguments and the briefs in which,
in March, 1920, the constitutional lawyers of America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
who disputed the presence of the new Amendment
in our Constitution, should have presented these irresistible
facts. Then we shall take up the arguments
and briefs of those other renowned lawyers in which
<i>they</i> presented those other facts (still unknown to us
average Americans) which can alone refute our knowledge
that the new Amendment never went into our
Constitution, because we are still citizens and governments
are yet unable to create government power to
interfere with our individual freedom.</p>

<p>“The important distinction so well understood in
America, between a <i>Constitution</i> established by
the people and <i>unalterable by the government</i>, and a
<i>law</i> established by the government and alterable by the
government, seems to have been little understood and
less observed in any other country.... Even in
Great Britain, where the principles of political and
civil liberty have been most discussed, and where we
hear most of the rights of the Constitution, it is maintained
that the authority of the Parliament is transcendent
and uncontrollable, as well with regard to the
Constitution, as the ordinary objects of legislative
provision. <i>They</i> [the legislature] have accordingly, in
several instances, <i>actually changed</i>, by legislative acts,
some of the most fundamental Articles of the government.”
(<i>Fed.</i> No. 53.)</p>

<p>Coming from Madison or Hamilton, this is the best
kind of testimony that the earlier Americans, who
established that constitution of government which is
the First Article, knew that it was “unalterable by
government.” And it is the best kind of testimony
that the same American makers of the Madison Fifth
Article knew that it did not grant to state governments
any ability to add to or subtract from the First Article
enumerated and constituted powers in government to
interfere with the freedom of American citizens. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
Madison and Hamilton had been with us in our Congress
of 1917, their statement would have been slightly
altered. They would have spoken of “the important
distinction so well understood in America” in 1787, as
one which “seems to have been little understood and
less observed in any other country” and not known or
observed at all by our Senators or Congressmen of
1917.</p>

<p>The Americans of 1787, who “so well understood”
the important distinction, made their knowledge a
noticeable thing in the language of their Statute of ’76
and of their Constitution. With their knowledge of
the important distinction, they permitted the respective
states, through the respective legislatures thereof,
to constitute the government of states, to make the
<i>federal</i> Articles of 1781. With their knowledge of the
important distinction and in deference to their own
clear Statute of ’76, these intelligent Americans refused
to permit the states or the legislatures of the
states to establish the government of men, to make the
<i>national</i> Article—the First Article—which is the constitution
of government power to interfere with individual
human freedom. Moreover, by their knowledge
of the important distinction and of the Statute, they
knew <i>that</i> Constitution, that enumerated grant of national
power over themselves, to be “unalterable by
government.” And that we and <i>all</i> later Americans
might also know it, <i>they</i>, the American people or “conventions”
of that day, insisted that the Tenth Amendment
expressly declare that they, those “conventions”
of the American people, reserved to themselves and
their posterity, the “conventions” of any later day,
exclusive ability to alter that constitution of <i>national</i>
power, the First Article. And, for the same purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
<i>they</i>, the “conventions,” mentioned themselves, the
particular reservee of the exclusive ability to alter that
grant of national power, in one particular earlier part
of the Articles they made, the part we know as the
Fifth Article. Naturally, the two men, who worded
that Article at Philadelphia and who paid its later
makers the deserved tribute to their knowledge of
the important distinction, mentioned those makers,
“conventions,” in that Fifth Article as future makers
of all grants of <i>national</i> power and mentioned the
legislatures, in the Fifth Article, as competent future
makers of Articles that do not constitute new <i>national</i>
government.</p>

<p>Because we have lived through the experience of the
Americans to whom the tribute was paid, we know the
distinction between a constitution of <i>national</i> government,
“unalterable by government,” and Articles constituting
government of political entities or states,
alterable by the states or the legislatures of the states.
Moreover, by reason of our experience, we sense the
clear recognition of the distinction in the Fifth Article
distinct mention of the people or “conventions,” as <i>sole</i>
makers of <i>national</i> Articles, and the similar mention
of the “legislatures” as competent makers of <i>federal</i>
Articles. To our regret, we have found that our
Congress, in 1917, knew naught of the distinction and
naught of its recognition in the language of the Tenth
Amendment and the Fifth Article. It is with relief,
therefore, that we turn to the great litigations in the
Supreme Court of 1920, in which the lawyers of the
America, where the important distinction was <i>once</i> so
clearly known, attacked and defended the proposal
from the Congress of 1917 and the action of the state
legislatures on that proposal. Fresh from the utter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
legislative ignorance of that distinction, it is with relief
that, in our first glance at the briefs of those lawyers,
we find what seems the clear echo of the accurate
knowledge we have acquired in the company of those
earlier Americans.</p>

<p>“There is only one great muniment of our liberty
which can never be amended, revoked or withdrawn—the
Declaration of Independence. In this regard, it
ranks with the Magna Charta.”</p>

<p>The clear tribute to the unrepealed Statute of ’76
excuses, while it does not explain, the error of the
allusion to Magna Charta. Graduate students of the
history of the advance of Americans from subjects to
free men, we average citizens grasp the error of the
statement, “in this regard [that neither can ever be
revoked] the Statute of ’76 ranks with the Magna
Charta.” We know that the Statute <i>was</i> the revocation
of the basic doctrine on which Magna Charta
rested. Magna Charta was the grant of privilege
from an omnipotent government to its subjects. All
that subjects ever have are the revocable privileges
granted by the master government. The Statute of
’76 states the basic American law that there are no
subjects in America, that the human members of any
political society or state or nation, except as they
directly grant power over some of their human rights
to secure enjoyment of the rest, need obey the command
of no one except Him who gave them their
human rights. In a free nation, such as the earlier
Americans made of themselves, no man has any privileges
<i>granted</i> by a master government. In a free
nation, citizens or members of the society (and the
supreme will therein) have their servant governments
to which those citizens give whatever <i>national</i> powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
those governments ever have. Except for the grants
of <i>such</i> power which those citizens so make, the human
beings retain, not as a gift or privilege of government
but as the gift of Him Who created them, all human
freedom of action. As <i>citizens</i>, they also possess the
particular privileges which arise from membership in
that particular society of men; but even those privileges
are not the gift of government but the creation
and effect of the society itself, just as every power of
the government is also the gift of the society.</p>

<p>We pardon the error of the reference to Magna
Charta, however, when we read on in the brief and
find it immediately quoting from our Statute: “We
hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable Rights; that among these are
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to
secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among
men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
Governed. That whenever any Form of Government
becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of
the <i>People</i> to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new
Government, laying its foundation on such principles
and organizing its powers on such form, as to <i>them</i>
shall seem most likely to effect <i>their</i> Safety and
Happiness.”</p>

<p>At last, in this brief, we are getting the clear echo of
our own knowledge that, <i>until this Statute is revoked</i>,
it is not the right of “<i>government or governments</i>” to
institute new government, laying its foundation on
such principles and organizing its powers in such form
as to “governments” shall seem most likely to effect
the safety and happiness “of governments.” Moreover,
in this brief, we are getting the clear echo of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
own knowledge that this Statute can <i>never</i> be revoked,
while we remain free men and citizens instead of the
subjects we were until that Statute was enacted.</p>

<p>And when we turn to another brief for a moment,
we are cheered to find the refutation of the Sheppard
ignorance of the identity of those who made <i>our</i> Constitution,
“We, the people of” America, in its Preamble
and its most important factor of the Tenth Amendment,
the “conventions” of ourselves in its Seventh
and its Fifth Articles. With gratification that some
“constitutional” lawyers still know and observe the
important distinction between the ability of ourselves,
the “conventions” of the Seventh and Fifth Articles,
and the lack of ability in the “legislatures” of the Fifth
Article to give to government <i>national</i> powers, we
average Americans recognize, in the following challenge
of <i>this</i> brief, the challenge we would have made
to the Sheppard proposition that legislatures attempt
to constitute such new government over us. This is the
challenge of the brief to Sheppard: “The Constitution
is not a compact between states. It proceeds <i>directly</i>
from the people. As was said by Mr. Chief Justice
Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 <i>Wheat.</i> 316,
etc.” Then follows the Marshall clear exposition of
how the people themselves, the “conventions,” made
the constitution which is the First Article and how, if
any other constitution of that kind, such as the Eighteenth
Amendment, is ever to be made “safely,
<i>effectively</i>, and wisely” it must be made by ourselves,
assembled in the “conventions” named in the Fifth
Article. The full extract from Marshall has been set
out already herein at page 98.</p>

<p>In a second brief, in a different case, the same distinguished
lawyer of 1920 is found bringing into bold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
relief another part of our knowledge so intimately connected
with the supposed new constitution of government,
the Eighteenth Amendment. And it is a part of
our knowledge which challenges a new constitution
made entirely by governments without any action by
ourselves, the people or the “conventions” named repeatedly
in the Constitution made by themselves. In
that other brief, we find him stating as one of the
propositions on which he bases his argument, “What
the expression ‘legislatures of the several states’ meant
as used in Article V, when that Article was adopted as
a part of the Constitution, it means now.” The statement
being undeniably true, he immediately proceeds
to urge, with equal truth, that “however popular approval
or disapproval [i.e., the <i>direct</i> action of the
people themselves, as, for example, in the ‘conventions’
whence, as he already stated, <i>our</i> Constitution
proceeded ‘directly from the people’] may be invoked,
the people do not become a ‘legislature.’... As
well confound the creator and the creature—the principal
and the agent through which he acts.”</p>

<p>This is the echo of Marshall’s clear statement of
the vital distinction between the same “legislatures”
(who never are the people and never have the reserved
ability of the people) and the “people” or “conventions”
(which are the people and have the exclusive
ability of the people). We recall the tribute paid to
this distinction at Philadelphia. We recall the legal
decision there, a decision based squarely on that distinction,
that the legislative ability to make <i>federal</i>
Articles could not constitute new government of men,
as did the First Article, and that all Articles like it
or the new Eighteenth Amendment must go to the
“people” of the Tenth Amendment, the “conventions”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
of the Seventh and Fifth Articles. We recall Marshall’s
appreciation of the accuracy of that legal decision,
when he mentioned that the ability of the state
governments or legislatures had been competent to
make the <i>federal</i> Articles of 1781 but, when it was
proposed to constitute government of men, to vest the
<i>national</i> powers of the <i>national</i> First Article, “the necessity
of deriving those powers directly from the
people [the “conventions” of the Seventh Article] was
known and recognized by all.” We remember that
the “people” or “conventions,” so recognizing and
knowing, mentioned themselves in the Fifth Article so
that no one ever should forget the similar legal necessity
that every Article like the First, such as the
new Article, must always be made by those “conventions”
so mentioned.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, with considerable satisfaction that
we read, in this brief of 1920, the clear echo of all
these settled facts, the knowledge that “legislatures”
never are the people and never become the people.
“As well confound the creator and the creature—the
principal and the agent.”</p>

<p>In our gratitude for such remembrance, we ignore
the inaccuracy of a suggestion that the “legislatures”
of the Fifth Article are the agent of the principal
therein mentioned, the “people” of America, the “conventions”
which made the Constitution. Each of those
“legislatures” is an agent of one particular reservee
among those named collectively in the reservation of
the Tenth Amendment in the words “to the states
<i>respectively</i>,” while the “conventions” in the Fifth Article
is the one most important reservee in that Tenth
Amendment, “the people” of America, the most important
factor in that Tenth Amendment and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
America. For the purpose of making any Articles,
whether federal or national, that important reservee
has no legislative agents. For any purpose, it has but
one legislative agent, the Congress; and to that one
legislative agent it has given no power to <i>make</i> any
constitutional Articles; but it has, in the Fifth Article,
<i>left</i> with that agent the mere ability to <i>draft</i> and <i>propose</i>
a new Article of either kind and, as did the
Philadelphia Convention, from the nature of the Article
it drafts, whether within the ability of “legislatures”
or within the exclusive unlimited ability of the
people or “conventions,” to <i>ascertain</i> and <i>propose</i>
which shall make the drafted Article.</p>

<p>That the state legislatures are not agents of the
American citizens, in that capacity, is self-evident.
Each legislature is chosen by the citizens of a state.
Moreover, the Constitution itself distinctly states that
the “conventions” of the American citizens grant no
power of any kind therein to the state “legislatures.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the American people created a national legislature,
with certain enumerated powers, it was neither necessary
nor proper to define the powers retained by the states.
These powers proceed, <i>not from the people of America</i>, but
from the people of the several states; and remain, after
the adoption of the Constitution, what they were before,
except so far as they may be abridged by that instrument.
(Marshall in Sturges v. Crowinshield, 4 <i>Wheat.</i> 122.)</p>
</div>

<p>That is why anything which <i>these</i> “legislatures” do,
when it comes in conflict with a valid action of <i>our</i>
legislature, the Congress, must always yield. We have
the supreme will in America, and when <i>our</i> agent, the
Congress, speaks with authority from us, it speaks for
us, while the inferior agents of other lesser wills never
speak for us. That clear distinction does not detract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
from the ability of those legislatures to make <i>federal</i>
Articles in our Constitution. They do not get that
ability from us, the citizens of America. They had
that ability from those respective inferior wills, when
we made our Constitution. By its exercise, they had
made the federation of states and the <i>federal</i> Articles
of its government. When we made our national Constitution,
we continued that federation and the ability
of its component members to make its federal Articles
and put them in our Constitution, which is both our
national Constitution and their federal Constitution.
The ability to make those <i>federal</i> Articles is one of the
powers reserved to those inferior wills by the reservation
of the Tenth Amendment which reads “to the
states respectively”; and it is not an ability to make
Articles which is granted in the Fifth Article. No
ability to make Articles is <i>granted</i> in that Fifth Article.</p>

<p>Inasmuch, however, as the writer of the brief in
1920 has known that “legislatures” do not ever become
“the people,” it is quite probable that his reference did
not intend to suggest that the legislatures of which he
spoke and who are the agents respectively of other
citizens, were the agents, for any purpose, of the citizens
of America. With his recognition that legislatures
never are the people and with the other quoted
extracts of those briefs of 1920 before us, echoing the
knowledge we have acquired, we feel at least that in
the court of 1920, from the debate of men who know,
we will learn whether and “when” and “how,” we,
between 1907 and 1917, became subjects instead of
the free men and citizens which we clearly were up
to 1907.</p>

<p>At least such was the thought of one American citizen,
when he read this quotation, in one of the briefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
of 1920, “that the people do not become a legislature....
As well confound the creator and the
creature—the principal and the agent through which
he acts.” It was almost incredible to this particular
American citizen that he found this statement and the
statement that—“The Constitution is not a compact
between states. It proceeds directly from the people.”—both
in the briefs of the foremost champion of the
new Amendment. And it seemed equally incredible to
him to find the quotation about the Statute of ’76 being
“one great muniment of our liberty which can never
be amended, revoked or withdrawn” in the brief of
the counsel for the political organization which dictated
the new state government command to the citizens
of America.</p>

<p>An unusual method had been adopted for the
hearing of what were later reported under the one
title the “National Prohibition Cases,” 253 <i>U.S.</i> 350.
In that hearing, which continued for days, seven different
litigations were argued because all dealt either
with the validity of the Eighteenth Amendment or
with the meaning of its remarkable second section or
with the statute enacted under that section and known
as the Volstead Act. For the same reason, the briefs
on both sides of the various litigations were clearly
the result of conference and collaboration. Nearly all
of the briefs, challenging the new Article, made their
challenge on the same two main points and in the expression
of those two challenges, made constant
reference to the different expression thereof in the
other briefs.</p>

<p>In the litigation and argument of that March, appeared
many of the best known lawyers in America.
Among them were distinguished counsel, appearing on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
behalf of those legislative governments who claim and,
in the new Article, have attempted to exercise the omnipotent
supremacy over the citizens of America which
was denied by the people of America to the British
Parliament. Among them were other distinguished
counsel, appearing on behalf of what had always
been known as the supreme legislative government
in America, <i>our government</i> with its <i>enumerated</i>
powers and without omnipotence over us. Among
them were still other distinguished counsel, appearing
on behalf of some separate states or political entities
to contend that there existed no <i>constitutional</i> ability
anywhere, even in ourselves, to take from their particular
state any more of its sovereignty than it had
surrendered in those early days when the states made
the Constitution, as Sheppard claimed in the Congress
of 1917. Among them were still other distinguished
counsel, some of them the most distinguished of all,
appearing to oppose, as best they knew how, the total
destruction of all <i>legitimate</i> industry in a business in
which it was the <i>human</i> right of Americans to engage
even before Americans wrote their Statute of ’76 and
consequently not a privilege of the citizen of America
or the citizen of any state.</p>

<p>As this fact has been the basis of many errors in that
comedy and tragedy of errors, which is the five-year
tale of the Eighteenth Amendment, we average Americans
may well dwell for a moment upon the certainty
of that fact. It is the natural mistake of those, who
have the Tory concept of the relation of men to government,
that they should first confuse the meaning of
the words “privilege of a citizen” with the words
“privilege of a subject” and thus believe that the nature
of both privileges, and the source of each are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
same. That mistake is but the echo of the error which
confuses the nature of Magna Charta with that of the
Statute of ’76. Magna Charta is the declaration of
certain privileges which government will permit its
subjects to keep as long as the government pleases.
The Statute of ’76 is the declaration that destroys the
relation of government to subjects, creates the relation
of citizens to their servant governments, and states
that the servants shall have no power to interfere with
the human rights of the masters, given by their Creator,
except such power as the masters choose to give,
and that the servants shall keep that power only so
long as the masters will. To the Tory concept, always
concentrated on the relation of subject to master
government, it is difficult of apprehension that the
human being is born with the right to use his human
freedom as he himself wills, so long as he does not
interfere with the similar exercise of human freedom
by the rest of us human beings. If men, in the exercise
of their free will, would always obey the defined law
of Him who created them, the exercise of human freedom
by one individual would never interfere with the
exercise of human freedom by all other individuals,
and no human government need ever be constituted.</p>

<p>Among the human rights of Americans, as of all
human beings, when they come into the world, is the
human right to do everything which is forbidden in the
first section of the Eighteenth Amendment. It is true,
as we frequently hear stated, that the Supreme Court
has decided that the right to do any of those things is
not the “privilege” of American citizens or of the
citizens of any state. It is also equally true, although
the Supreme Court has never been called upon to decide
that very obvious fact, that the right to breathe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
is not the “privilege” of an American citizen or of the
citizen of a state. Both rights are among the rights of
human beings, <i>as such</i>, and they are each of them
among the rights of themselves, which we, “the
people” of America, established and ordained our Constitution
to secure. When we established that Constitution
for that purpose, we admittedly gave our only
American government no power to make the command
of the first section of the Eighteenth Amendment.
That is why the governments of <i>other</i> citizens were
asked to make the command to ourselves, the citizens
of America.</p>

<p>Each of the Americans, who created the nation that
is America, already lived as a member and citizen of
a state. In that state, when they had constituted it,
the citizens <i>thereof</i> had subjected their human right
(to do what the new Amendment says shall not be
done) to a power in the government of that state (a
power which <i>they</i> gave it and can take back from it) to
make that kind of a command <i>to them</i> in that matter.</p>

<p>We thus have clearly in our minds that the individual
in America has the human right (with which the
new Amendment interferes) and that it is subject to
the interference of no government, except as the citizens
of that particular government have given it power
so to interfere with it. The undoubted fact that the
right itself is not the privilege of the citizen of
America or the citizen of the state is simply another
way of saying that the original human right itself is not
granted to the human being by government or governments
but by the Creator Who made him. Without
the Tory concept, no man would even make the mistake
of believing that a citizen gets any of his privileges
from any government. The privileges of a citizen are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
the things which he acquires by his voluntary association
with the other citizens as the members of a political
society which is the nation. The human rights of
the same individual are the rights which he brings into
that association and subjects to whatever powers of its
government are granted by himself and those other
citizens with whom he associates as the nation.</p>

<p>Of course, the early Americans, with whom we have
now been educated, not only knew these things clearly
and accurately, but on their knowledge of them based
everything that they did in the fifteen years which we
have lived with them. The Americans of today, who uphold
the new constitution of government made entirely
by government, do not know them at all or understand
them when they hear them. Neither would the aristocrats
of France, before the French Revolution, nor the
Tories of England, even at the time of our Revolution,
have known or understood them. That is why the
Americans continued their Revolution and won it, so
that these things might be the basis of every government
interference with any human right. Later they
made the American Constitution solely to secure the
greatest possible protected enjoyment of all individual
human rights. That security is one of the privileges
acquired by citizenship in the society which that Constitution
created. Wherefore, it is of interest for us
to know how clearly Madison, who largely planned
that Constitution and who worded its Fifth Article,
did know and understand these facts in relation even
to the very things forbidden in the new constitution of
government made entirely by government.</p>

<p>In the House of Representatives, in the first session
of the new Congress with the enumerated powers of
the First Article, on May 15, there came up for discussion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
“a proposed bill laying duties on goods.”
Madison “moved to lay an impost of eight cents on
all beer imported. He did not think this would be a
monopoly, but he hoped it would be such an encouragement
so as to induce the manufacture to take deep root
in every state of the Union.” (4 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 345.)</p>

<p>That the knowledge of Madison was not unknown
to the Supreme Court a century later, in 1890, is a
matter of record.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That ardent spirits, distilled liquors, ale, and beer are
subjects of exchange, barter, and traffic, like any other
commodity <i>in which a right of traffic exists</i>, and are so
recognized by the usages of the commercial world, the laws
of Congress, and the decisions of courts, is not denied.
(Leisy v. Hardin, 135 <i>U. S.</i> 100.)</p>
</div>

<p>Returning to the courtroom of 1920, therefore,
we are sincerely glad to note the appearance of quite
an array of eminent counsel on behalf of those legitimately
engaged in a business which is just as
legitimate an exercise of human right, as it was
when Madison hoped that it would take deep root in
every state of the America he loved so well, a business
which will continue free from <i>unlawful</i> usurpation of
power by government so long as the Constitution
planned by Madison is obeyed by governments in
America. It is too bad that the eminent counsel, who
shared Madison’s views in relation to that legitimate
business, did not also have Madison’s accurate knowledge
of the only way in which legitimate government
power can be created to interfere with that or any
other human right, the way which Madison so clearly
stated in the Fifth Article—by grant from the “conventions”
of American citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>When we average Americans look over the great
array of counsel and the respective clients whose
causes they champion, one fact lends no encouragement
to our hope that we may learn the merits of the claim
that, somehow between 1907 and 1917 we became
subjects and lost our status as free men. Although
each client is represented by his own distinguished attorneys
and although eminent counsel argue and file
briefs, as <i>amici curiæ</i>, on behalf of the state governments
which claim that we are subjects and on behalf
of some of the litigating other states and individuals,
no <i>amicus curiæ</i> files any brief on behalf of us, the citizens
of America, the reservees of the Tenth Amendment,
the “conventions” of the Seventh and the Fifth
Articles.</p>

<p>There is, however, this comfort. If, <i>because</i> the
counsel in opposition to the new Amendment do not
know and urge our legal protection against any new
constitution of <i>national</i> government except by ourselves,
the citizens of America, the “conventions” of
the Fifth Article, and if, <i>because</i> of such ignorance on
the part of counsel, the Court should not be called upon
either to consider or pass upon our protection, no decision
of the Court will be intended to have—as no
decision of the Court could have—any effect upon our
protection. If counsel fail to bring before the Court
the legal facts which demonstrate that the new Amendment
is not in the Constitution unless we Americans
are “subjects,” our day in Court is merely postponed.
And when that day shall come, when that Court is addressed
by counsel who do represent the citizens of
America and who accurately know the constitutional
protection which we have for all our rights, there is
not the slightest danger that the Court, established and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
maintained by us for the sole purpose of protecting
our individual rights against usurpation by government,
will decide that we are subjects and that governments
can create new government power to interfere
with the freedom of the individual American citizen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, let us examine the briefs of March,
1920. In them, despite our regret that not one of
them was written in our behalf, it may be possible, it
ought to be a certainty, that we will hear something
about the “when” and the “how,” <i>after</i> 1907, we are
supposed to have lost our status as free men and citizens
of America.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br><span class="small">BRIEFS IGNORE THE AMERICAN CITIZEN</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There is one man whose skill as an artist could
do justice to the atmosphere in which all the
briefs of that March must have been written. Unfortunately,
the reports of the death of that man are
no longer greatly exaggerated. It is unfortunate that
the man who pictured the sensations of a Yankee in
King Arthur’s Court could not have lived to reverse
the feat. Only his genius could picture one of the
Americans of 1790 living in the atmosphere of the
briefs of 1920 <i>for</i> the new Amendment and learning
therein that the Americans of his own day never became
citizens of America. Only the unique word-artist,
who defined a cauliflower as a cabbage with a
college education, could adequately state the startling
fact that not one of the briefers knew that all were
assembled in the court room of March, 1920, seriously
to debate whether the Americans in 1788 voluntarily
surrendered their status as free men and, repealing
their Statute of ’76, declared themselves and their
posterity subject to a legislative government superior
to what they called their supreme legislature, a legislative
government “invested with power to legislate
for us in all cases whatsoever.”</p>

<p>Because Mark Twain is dead, we must get from
those briefs, without his aid, the knowledge that the
new Article depends entirely on the extraordinary concept
that the Fifth Article constituted a hitherto unknown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
government of all American citizens, not our
government of enumerated First Article powers but
an entirely distinct government—not a member of it
chosen by American citizens—“invested with power to
legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.”</p>

<p>In other words, we are to learn from the briefs <i>for</i>
the new Article that our supposed only and supreme
American government is, and that all American citizens
are, subject to the omnipotence of a still more
supreme legislative government, consisting of the state
legislative governments on whose behalf some of the
most distinguished lawyers of 1920 appeared. It is
the clear concept of those lawyers that upon the <i>will</i> of
the governments they represented, a will subject to the
restraint of no Constitution in America, depends entirely
what measure of human freedom we individual
American citizens may enjoy. This concept stands out
clear and sharply defined in their briefs, although neither
they nor their opponent lawyers grasp the fact. On the
fact that the Fifth Article <i>mentions</i> their client governments,
the state legislatures, they base the entire claim
that the Eighteenth Amendment is in our Constitution.
On this <i>mention</i> rests their extraordinary assumption
that the Fifth Article is a <i>“grant”</i> of power to those
governments—and to the very “conventions” which
made the Fifth Article—to make new Articles of every
kind, whether <i>federal</i> to govern states or <i>national</i> to
interfere with the freedom of the individual.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we are to learn, from the briefs of
the lawyers <i>against</i> the new Article, that they all assert,
like their opponents, that the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a
<i>grant</i> of power to the grantors and to the state governments.
To our amazement, in the briefs of the
lawyers <i>against</i> the new Article, we shall find no knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
of or insistence upon the important fact that the
Constitution is both a <i>federal</i> and a <i>national</i> Constitution.
Most amazing of all, in no brief of any lawyer,
shall we find the faintest recognition of the <i>decisive</i>
fact that the “conventions” of the Fifth Article are the
American citizens themselves, while the state “legislatures”
of the Fifth Article are respectively the attorneys
in fact for respective citizens of other political
entities than the nation which is America. Most briefs,
<i>for</i> the new Amendment, will dwell upon the fact that
the people of America, not the states, made the Constitution.
Yet, although it is equally true to say that
the whole people of America or the “conventions” of
the Seventh Article made the Constitution, no briefer
will know that the “conventions” of the Fifth Article
are also the whole people of America, while the state
“legislatures” never are the attorneys in fact for the
citizens of America, who never chose a single member
of those “legislatures.”</p>

<p>That all those lawyers, who debated the <i>extent</i> of
the imaginary “grant” of power in the Fifth Article,
may do themselves strict justice, let us accurately state
a few indisputable facts before we consider their briefs.</p>

<p>It <i>is</i> a fact that the subject matter of the first section
command and the second section grant, in the Eighteenth
Amendment, is the exercise of a human right,
not the privilege of a citizen of America or the citizen
of any state.</p>

<p>It <i>is</i> a fact that the Americans in each former colony,
in 1776, constituted a state for themselves and a
government of that state and subjected that particular
right, as all <i>their</i> individual human rights, to the general
welfare state power of <i>that</i> government, the
power which is now known as the police power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p>It <i>is</i> a fact that, from 1776 to 1787, that particular
individual right, as <i>all</i> the human rights of the citizens
of any state, was subject to no interference by any government
or governments in the world except the one
legislative government of that particular state. It <i>is</i>
a fact that all the legislative governments of the other
states and the government of the federation of states
could neither exercise nor grant, as some of them have
attempted to do in the Eighteenth Amendment, any
power to interfere with that particular individual freedom
or any other individual freedom of the citizens
in that particular state.</p>

<p>It <i>is</i> a fact that, on June 21, 1788, the Americans
in the nine states became collectively one political
entity, the citizens of America, composing the nation
which is America. It <i>is</i> a fact, <i>and a fact which flatly
denies the existence of the Eighteenth Amendment</i>,
that, on June 21, 1788, the existing state legislatures
did not become an omnipotent legislative body of the
new nation “invested with power to legislate” for
American citizens “in all cases whatsoever” in interference
with our individual freedom. It <i>is</i> a fact that
those legislatures did not then become any government
for the citizens of America on any subject whatsoever.</p>

<p>It <i>is</i> a fact that not one of those state legislatures
received any new power to interfere with human freedom
anywhere by any grant of <i>such</i> power in the seven
Articles of our Constitution. The opening words of
the First Article expressly so declare. They are, “All
legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a
Congress of the United States, which shall consist of
a Senate and a House of Representatives.” Moreover,
the Tenth Amendment, the declaration insisted upon
by the whole “people” of America in their “conventions,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
expressly so declares. Its declaration is that the
entire Constitution gives no new power to any government
except the new government of America, the
government constituted by the First Article.</p>

<p>It <i>is</i> a fact, again a fact which denies the existence
of the Eighteenth Amendment, that the <i>general constitutional
restrictions upon government power to interfere
with individual freedom</i> are restraints upon the
exercise of every grant of such power in the Constitution,
and that they do not restrain the state governments
<i>because those governments are the donee of no
power of that kind in that Constitution</i>. This fact, a
patent fact hardly needing settlement, was decisively
settled in 1833 by the decision of the Supreme Court,
announced by Marshall, in Barron v. Mayor of Baltimore,
7 <i>Peters</i>, 43. Barron contended that the Fifth
Amendment restrained the power of the state governments.
Marshall said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The question thus presented is, we think, of great importance,
<i>but not of much difficulty</i>. The Constitution
was ordained and established by the people of the United
States for themselves, for their own government, and not
for the government of the individual states. Each state
established a constitution for itself, and in that constitution
provided such limitations and restrictions on the powers
of its particular government as its judgment dictated. The
people of the <i>United States</i> framed <i>such</i> a government for
the United States as <i>they</i> supposed best adapted to <i>their</i>
situation, and best calculated to promote <i>their</i> interests.
The powers <i>they</i> conferred on this government were to be
exercised by <i>itself;</i> and the limitations on power, if expressed
in general terms, are naturally, and, we think,
necessarily, applicable to the <i>government created by the
instrument.</i> They are limitations of power <i>granted in the
instrument itself;</i> not of distinct governments, framed by
different persons and for different purposes.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>The decision settled that the entire Constitution
vested in the state governments not a single power to
interfere with individual freedom in any respect. The
decision is based on that one fact. The fact and decision
expose the absurdity of the thought that the
Fifth Article is a “<i>grant</i>” of any <i>such</i> power to the
state governments, much less a grant of <i>every</i> such
power to those governments. This absurd thought,
however, is the assumption on which every advocate
of the Eighteenth Amendment based his argument in
March, 1920: and it is the assumption upon which
wholly depends the existence of the Amendment.</p>

<p>It <i>is</i> a fact that the state legislatures, before the
Constitution was even proposed, had existing ability
to make <i>federal</i> Articles. It <i>is</i> a fact, as the Tenth
Amendment declares, that the “conventions” of the
Seventh Article <i>reserved</i> that <i>federal</i> ability to those
state governments and that the Fifth Article did
not “<i>grant</i>” it to them. It <i>is</i> a fact, that the “conventions”
of ourselves, the American citizens assembled
in their respective states, the “conventions”
of the Seventh <i>and</i> the Fifth Article, even before
the Constitution was worded or proposed, had <i>exclusive</i>
ability to make <i>national</i> Articles, which either
directly interfere or grant ability to interfere with
individual freedom. It <i>is</i> a fact that this power of
the “conventions” included the ability to make any
kind of Article, either <i>federal</i> or <i>national</i>. It <i>is</i> a
fact, therefore, as the “conventions” of the American
citizens had this omnipotent power before the Fifth
Article was even drafted, and as the Tenth Amendment
states that <i>they</i> reserved it to <i>themselves</i>, that
they did not grant <i>all of it</i> (as the advocates of
the new Amendment claimed in March, 1920), or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
<i>part of it</i> (as the opponents of the new Amendment
claimed in March, 1920) to themselves in their own
Fifth Article. It <i>is</i> a fact, therefore, that the <i>mention</i>
of the two existing abilities (the existing omnipotent
ability of the “conventions” and the existing <i>limited</i>
ability of the “state legislatures”) does <i>not</i> make the
Fifth Article any “<i>grant</i>” of power either to the “conventions”
(who made the Article) or to the state
“legislatures.”</p>

<p>It <i>is</i> a fact that the very “conventions” named in
the Fifth Article and the American citizens assembled
therein, while they were making that Article, accurately
knew that it was nothing but a <i>constitutional</i>
mode of procedure for two distinct and existing
powers, and that it did not “<i>grant</i>” any power whatever
to the state governments.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Constitution, with its Fifth Article,
the entire convention in Virginia declared that all the
powers granted in the Constitution were being granted
by the people <i>of America</i> “and that every power, not
granted thereby, remains with <i>them</i>, and at <i>their</i> will.”
Nothing could more clearly express the knowledge that
the Fifth Article was not a grant of any power by the
“conventions” to the “conventions” or to the state
governments. In the Virginia convention, Lee stated:
“This new system shows, in stronger terms than words
could declare, that the liberties of the people are
secure. It goes on the principle that all power is
in the people, and that rulers have no powers but
what are <i>enumerated</i> [in the First Article] in that
paper.... Candor must confess that it is infinitely
more attentive to the liberties of the people than any
state government.” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 186.)</p>

<p>In the South Carolina convention, Pinckney said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
“With us, the sovereignty of the Union is in the
people” (4. <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 328), and again “I conceive it as
<i>indispensable</i>, in a republic, that all authority should
flow from the people.” (4 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 326.)</p>

<p>Hamilton, one of the people assembled in the New
York convention, said: “As the people are the only
legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that
the constitutional charter, under which the several
branches of government hold their power, is derived,
it seems strictly consonant to the republican theory, to
recur to the same original authority,” the people themselves,
the “conventions” of the Fifth Article and the
Seventh, “whenever it may be necessary to enlarge,
diminish, or new-model the powers of government.”
(<i>Fed.</i> No. 49.) He could hardly have made more clear
his knowledge that the Fifth Article was not a “grant”
of power to the state governments. As Madison and
Hamilton proposed and seconded the only Fifth Article,
at Philadelphia, which ever mentioned the state legislatures,
their own words have great weight in the
interpretation of its language. For which reason, it
is well to recall again that Madison, in <i>Federalist</i>
Number 37, clearly said that “the genius of republican
liberty seems to demand ... not only that all
power should be derived from the people.” And
either Madison or Hamilton said in <i>The Federalist</i>,
Number 49, the reference to the Fifth Article being
unmistakable from what they said, “There is certainly
great force in this reasoning, and it must be allowed
to prove that a constitutional road to the decision of
the people ought to be marked out and kept open, for
certain great and extraordinary occasions.” As they
both maintained, at the Philadelphia Convention and
thereafter, that the ability of state governments was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
incompetent to constitute government with national
powers to interfere with human freedom, and as they
both repeatedly stated that it would be contrary to the
genius of republican liberty that <i>any</i> governments
should have that ability, they have made unmistakable
<i>their</i> knowledge that the Fifth Article, which they proposed
and seconded and which Madison probably
worded, did not grant any such ability to governments.</p>

<p>In the Pennsylvania convention, Wilson clearly expressed
the knowledge which reads the new Eighteenth
Amendment out of our Constitution, when he said:
“In this Constitution, the <i>citizens</i> of the United States
appear dispensing a part of their original power in
what manner and what proportion <i>they</i> think fit. They
never part with the whole; and they retain the right of
recalling what they part with.” (2 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 437.)
Can any man, even a modern “constitutional” lawyer,
reconcile that knowledge with the thought that the
Fifth Article is a grant of power to the state governments?
Again in the same convention, he said, speaking
of our Constitution: “Here, sir, the fee simple of
power remains in the people <i>at large</i> and by this Constitution
<i>they</i> do not part with it.” (2 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 435.)
In the North Carolina convention, Iredell, later on the
Supreme Court Bench, said: “No man, let his ingenuity
be what it will, could enumerate all the individual
rights not relinquished by this Constitution.” (4 <i>Ell.
Deb.</i> 149.)</p>

<p>All these facts should be dwelt upon and emphasized
in the briefs of the lawyers <i>against</i> the new Article in
which government attempts to exercise ungranted
power and to grant new power to interfere with the
individual freedom of the American citizen. And
against all <i>our</i> education in the “conventions,” it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
be the burden of the briefs of the lawyers <i>for</i> the new
Amendment to uphold the amazing proposition that
all the individual rights of the American citizens were,
by the Fifth Article, made subject to a supposed
omnipotence granted to the state governments, not a
member of which is chosen by the citizens of America.</p>

</div>


<p>We average Americans, therefore, come to the
courtroom of 1920 with some knowledge that is
a mathematical certainty. We know that everything
done at Philadelphia by the “conventions” named in
the Seventh Article was done with one dominant purpose—the
security of individual human freedom. We
know that, at Philadelphia and in those “conventions,”
the old states and their governments, the <i>federal</i> government
and its continuation in the new Constitution,
the new nation and its Constitution and its government
were only important as the American citizens considered
that each or all would contribute to the security
of American <i>individual</i> freedom. We know that, only
in rare instances, such as that of Gerry, did a Tory
mental attitude lead a man into the error (for any
American after ’76) of thinking that political entities
(such as states or nations or their governments) have
the slightest importance except in so far as they contribute
to the individual freedom of the citizens who
create them and <i>must</i> control them, if an American is
to remain a citizen. We know that every American,
in those “conventions,” discussed and voted upon every
mention of these political entities, with insistent realization
that nothing anywhere in the Constitution was
intended to disturb or did disturb the legal fact that
only the citizens of America, in “conventions,” ever
could say <i>how much national power</i> the new government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
should have, <i>how much</i> each old state should be
allowed to retain over its own citizens and <i>how much</i>
the citizens of America should reserve from all governments
in America. We also know this legal fact to
have been the most important legal fact in America to
the Americans in those “conventions.” We know that
it was the legal fact whose denial by the British Parliament
caused the Revolution. We know that, from
July 4, 1776, everything which the Americans did
was solely to make it impossible that any one could
ever deny this legal fact in America.</p>

<p>And we also know, something that has been entirely
ignored since 1917, that these “conventions” knew that
the “conventions” of the Seventh and the Fifth Articles
were identically the same thing and were the most
important reservee in the Tenth Amendment, “the
people” of America, in their aggregate and collective
capacity as Henry accurately put it.</p>

<p>With this simple and amazingly important knowledge
of facts, a knowledge acquired by our education
with the Americans who made themselves and their
posterity free men instead of “subjects,” we come to
the arguments and briefs of 1920. There we expect
to learn how the opponents of the Eighteenth Amendment
presented and its supporters answered these
facts. Because these facts we do know, if they are <i>all</i>
the facts, flatly deny the existence of that new <i>national</i>
Article, made by governments alone.</p>

<p>If forbearance were the sole rule for conduct, if
conscience permitted us to ignore the great danger to
our own <i>individual</i> freedom in <i>every</i> matter, we would
be absolutely silent as to the contents of all those
briefs. But, that the <i>supposed</i> presence of the new
<i>national</i> Article in the <i>national</i> Constitution of a free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
people may never be a precedent for other <i>government</i>
making of <i>national</i> Articles, it is our duty to learn and
state what those briefs all disclose.</p>

<p>Not one of them recognizes the identity of the “conventions”
of the Fifth Article with the “conventions”
of the Seventh. And all ignore the identity of the
Fifth Article “conventions” with “We, the people” of
America, in the Preamble, and with the most important
reservee of the Tenth Amendment, “the people” of
America.</p>

<p>Every argument, whether for or against the new
<i>national</i> article, is based upon the sheer and absurd
assumption that the “conventions” in their Fifth Article
<i>did</i> make a <i>grant</i> to themselves, the “conventions,”
and to the state governments. The advocates
of the new Article assume that the “conventions”
<i>granted</i> to themselves and to the state governments <i>all</i>
the inalienable omnipotence of the American people
themselves, in their aggregate capacity as the citizens
of America, the very omnipotence the supposed
grantors were exercising when they made the Fifth
Article. The opponents of the new <i>national</i> Article
assert the absurd assumption of a “<i>grant</i>,” but contend
for diverse reasons—remarkable by reason of the
fallacy of a “<i>grant</i>” on which each rests—that the
“conventions” grant to themselves <i>only a part</i> of the
omnipotence which they already had and were exercising
when they made the supposed “grant.” On which
theory, they urge that the supposed “grant” to the
state governments, being identical with the supposed
“grant” to the grantors themselves, is <i>only part</i> of the
omnipotence which the grantors already had and does
not include ability to make Articles like the Eighteenth
Amendment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span></p>

<p>Not one of these briefs recognizes or urges that the
Fifth Article is not a “grant” of ability <i>to make</i> Articles
whether <i>federal</i> or <i>national</i>. No brief knows
the Fifth Article to be simply the ratification, by the
whole American people, of a hitherto revolutionary
mode of procedure as the future <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span>
mode in which may be exercised either the existing and
limited ability of state legislatures to make <i>federal</i>
Articles or the existing and unlimited ability of the
“people” (the “conventions”) to make <i>any</i> Articles.
No brief either recognizes or urges the absurdity of
the thought that the “conventions” intended to grant
or did grant to themselves, the “conventions,” any part
of the omnipotence which the supposed grantors were
actually exercising when making the supposed grant.</p>

<p>No brief recognizes that one of the supposed
grantees <i>is</i> the supposed grantor. No brief seems to
know that the supposed grantees were respectively
competent makers of certain kinds of Articles even
before the Fifth Article was written at Philadelphia.
No brief seems to know—or to sense the decisive effect
of the fact—that, within the twelve years which immediately
preceded the supposed “grant,” each of the two
respective makers of Articles, who are mentioned in the
Fifth Article, had exercised its respective ability to
make Articles <i>of a certain kind</i>. No brief seems to
know that one of the supposed grantees, the “conventions,”
at the very moment of the supposed “grant,”
was exercising its own unlimited ability to make Articles
of every kind. For all that the briefs disclose, in
the decisive effect of the two facts upon the supposed
validity of the Eighteenth Amendment, the “state
legislatures” might never have made the <i>federal</i> Articles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
of 1781 and the “conventions” might never have
made the <i>federal</i> and <i>national</i> Articles of 1788.</p>

<p>No brief urges the greatest legal decision made at
Philadelphia in 1787 as binding legal authority that
the state “legislatures” of the Fifth Article <i>never</i> can,
while the Fifth Article “conventions” <i>always</i> can, make
a <i>national</i> Article like the First Article or the Eighteenth
Amendment. One brief does suggest that decision
as authority for the absurd proposition that the
Fifth Article mentions no <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode in
which even the exclusive ability of the “conventions”
of the American citizens can be again exercised to
make Articles like the First Article and the Eighteenth
Amendment. In urging that absurd proposition, the
briefer wholly ignores the fact that the Philadelphia
Convention, which made that legal decision, reached
its conclusion by ascertaining what were and still are
the <i>respective</i> abilities (to make Articles) of the state
“legislatures” and the “conventions,” both of which
are named as future makers in the Fifth Article.</p>

<p>No brief recognizes the fact (or urges any argument
based upon it) that the Constitution <i>is</i> both a <i>federal</i>
and a <i>national</i> Constitution. For which reason, no
brief points out that the Tenth Amendment expressly
reserves the ability to make <i>federal</i> Articles to the
state “legislatures” and the exclusive ability to make
<i>national</i> Articles to the “conventions.” For which
reason, no brief points out that each of the two
reservees, named in the Tenth Amendment, is mentioned
separately in the Fifth Article as a possible
maker of future articles, whenever a proposed future
Article is of the kind which the existing ability of the
proposed maker is competent to make.</p>

<p>No brief, <i>against</i> the new Amendment, challenges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
the sheer and absurd assumption that the Fifth Article
<i>is</i> a “grant.” No brief, <i>for</i> the new Amendment, offers
or suggests the slightest fact in support of that sheer
assumption.</p>

<p>Every brief <i>for</i> the new Amendment, on the fallacy
of the <i>sheer assumption</i> that the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a
grant, contends that the Article makes a fractional part
of the state legislatures an omnipotent Parliament for
the American people, a Parliament not restrained by
any constitutional limitations in state or national constitutions
but a Parliament which can do what it will
with every individual right of every human being in
America. These briefs neither know nor care that
their concept of the Fifth Article means that the “conventions”
of the American citizens, twelve years after
the Declaration of Independence, intended to make
and did make themselves absolute “subjects” of governments,
not one of whose legislators was to be
elected by Americans in their capacity as American
citizens. The foremost of these briefs were written
by eminent “constitutional” lawyers who had, as clients,
the very governments which claimed this omnipotence
over individual Americans as their “subjects.”</p>

<p>Every brief, <i>against</i> the new Amendment, not only
admitted but asserted the absurd assumption that the
Fifth Article is a “grant” to the grantors and to the
state governments. In the foremost brief against the
new Amendment, that absurd assumption is asserted
or mentioned over fifty times. On this absurd assumption,
every argument, in <i>these</i> briefs, as well as in the
opposing briefs, is based. In this respect, there was
but one difference between any brief and another.
That difference was in reference to the <i>extent</i> of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
supposed “grant” which the grantors made to themselves
and to the state governments.</p>

<p>Not one brief, presented in these litigations of 1920,
knew or urged the undoubted fact that, <i>because</i> our
government is both federal and national, if it wants
new power to interfere with the freedom of the
American citizen, that government can get that power
in only one <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode, through the “conventions”
named in the Fifth Article. No briefer
knew the legal necessity that all power <i>of that kind</i>
must be obtained directly from the citizens of America,
assembled in their “conventions.” We ourselves know
that there was a day in America when that legal necessity
“was felt and acknowledged by all.” It is almost
impossible for us, therefore, educated as we are in the
experience of the Americans who did know, to believe
these statements about these briefs. Yet the briefs
speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Before, however, we turn to verify the statements
by the briefs themselves, it is well that we recall one
amazing question and answer, during the arguments
of 1920 in the Supreme Court, which question and answer
overwhelmingly demonstrate that none of these
“constitutional” lawyers knew or cared about the facts
we know.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court had listened, for several days,
to many clever arguments against the new <i>national</i>
Article. The arguments had challenged validity on
the ground that the new Article infringed upon the
political freedom of some political entity, such as a
state or its government. Sometimes the arguments
had challenged validity on the ground that the new
Article infringed upon the liberty of the citizens <i>of
some particular state</i>. No argument had challenged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
validity on the one patent and unanswerable ground
that the “conventions” of 1788 had provided that no
<i>national</i> Article, which (like the First Article and the
Eighteenth Amendment) directly interferes with or
grants power to interfere with individual liberty of
the American citizen, could ever be <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONALLY</span>
made, except in the one <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode
of procedure, in which the <i>only</i> competent makers of
<i>national</i> Articles can make <i>such</i> Articles, the “conventions
in three fourths of” the states, mentioned in the
Fifth Article.</p>

<p>Rice of Rhode Island, one of the many prominent
lawyers <i>against</i> validity, was urging his particular
argument. Ignoring the citizens of America in the
“conventions” of the Fifth Article, he claimed that
no power in America could interfere with individuals
in Rhode Island, outside the First Article matters,
without the consent of Rhode Island itself. He was
interrupted by the Court. In substance, this is the
question and answer that followed: Justice Brandeis:
“The court is now fully acquainted with the nature of
the arguments of the various counsel as to why the
new Article has <i>not</i> been validly made. The Court
would like to know, In what way do counsel think that
the new Article <i>could</i> be <i>constitutionally</i> made?” And
the answer of Rice, undoubtedly voicing the conviction
of all his colleagues, for none of them had any other
answer to volunteer, was: “<i>In no way.</i>”</p>

<p>Fresh from the “conventions,” which knew that
<i>they</i> could have made what is supposed to be the Eighteenth
Amendment, we could make the correct answer
to that question. Our answer is that the “conventions”
of the whole American people could have made this
new Article in 1788 just as they did make the First<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
Article of exactly the same kind. They could have
made it, not because any Constitution gave them the
power to make it. They could have made it because,
in its making, they would have exercised exactly the
same existing ability which they exercised when they
destroyed the power of the British Government over
themselves in 1776, which they exercised when they
ended the complete independence of each state in 1788
and which they exercised when they made <i>all</i> the Articles
of 1788. When they did each of these things,
they had prescribed no “constitutional” mode of procedure
in which they might <i>constitutionally</i> exercise
that exclusive ability of their own. By the declaration
of the Tenth Amendment, they reserved that exclusive
ability to themselves. And, in the Fifth Article, they
prescribed, for the first time, exactly the same mode,
in which they were then exercising that exclusive
ability, as the future <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode for its
further exercise. As Marshall stated, in the Supreme
Court, there is but one way in which they can exercise
it, “safely, effectively, and wisely,” by assembling in
their “conventions” in their respective states.</p>

<p>If the accuracy and truth of this sole possible correct
answer to the question of 1920 is so well known to us,
certainly it should have been known to at least one
of the “constitutional” lawyers of 1920. Moreover,
<i>every</i> “constitutional” lawyer of 1920 should have
known that the mention of state governments in the
Fifth Article was not intended to make them omnipotent
over the individual rights of the American citizen
or to provide an unsafe, ineffectual and unwise way or
any way in which government in America could create
new government power to interfere with individual
freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span></p>

<p>Madison wrote the Fifth Article. Immediately
after he had secured its proposal from Philadelphia,
in the Virginia convention he paid his famous tribute
to the “conventions”—but not to the “state legislatures”—which
he mentions in his Fifth Article. “Mr.
Chairman, nothing has excited more admiration in the
world than the manner in which free governments have
been established in America; for it was the first instance,
from the creation of the world to the American
Revolution, that free inhabitants have been seen deliberating
on the form of government, and selecting
such of their citizens as possessed their confidence, to
determine upon and give effect to it.” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i>
616.)</p>

<p>But, whatever the ignorance of our constitutional
lawyers, <i>we</i> know why Madison, in his Fifth Article,
mentions these “conventions” in which free inhabitants
are seen deliberating on new grants or constitutions of
government power to interfere with individual freedom.
When future grants of such power are suggested,
there is to be a <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode prescribed
for the reassembling of such “conventions” to
make or refuse the grants.</p>

<p>Our experience with Madison and his colleagues
would educate these “constitutional” lawyers to keen
realization that the Americans of old knew the vital
distinction, so important to individual liberty, between
permanent and existing state legislatures and these
“conventions” of the American people themselves,
chosen for the one purpose of answering “Yes” or
“No” to a particular question previously carefully considered
by all the American citizens.</p>

<p>Let these “constitutional” lawyers spend a moment
with Hamilton, on Friday, March 14, 1788, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
he was urging the American people to adopt the Constitution
with that Fifth Article.</p>

<p>He was discussing the mode which that Constitution
provided for the election of the Chief Executive of
the new nation. The mode was that the <i>American</i>
citizens, in each state, should elect a temporary convention
of delegates to deliberate upon and cast the
votes of Americans in that state for some American
as President. We sense, at once, the striking similarity
between the temporary body, thus to be chosen for <i>that</i>
purpose, and the temporary body or convention also
to be chosen to pass upon the <i>other</i> single question, a
“Yes” or “No” to some particular proposed new grant
of government power to interfere with individual freedom.
The danger to individual liberty would necessarily
be much less in having a permanent government
body, the legislature, cast the vote of the Americans
in its state <i>for an Executive</i>, than in having the same
permanent government body or legislature say the
“Yes” or “No” of the Americans in that state <i>to a new
grant of government power</i> to interfere with the individual
liberty of all Americans. Therefore, if we find
Hamilton dwelling upon the danger of state legislatures
casting American votes for the American Executive,
we can be quite certain that neither Madison nor
Hamilton nor their colleagues <i>mentioned</i> the existing
ability of legislatures to make <i>federal</i> Articles (when
these men worded and made their Fifth Article) in
order that their words might be twisted away from any
possible English meaning and say that the citizens of
America appointed these state governments, not a
member of which is chosen by the citizens of America,
to be their omnipotent attorney in fact for every purpose
in the world, forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span></p>

<p>This is what Hamilton had to say on the danger to
liberty, if permanent state legislative governments, instead
of special American delegates chosen for that
purpose, should even elect the American President:
“The mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate
of the United States is almost the only part of the
system, of any consequence, which has escaped without
severe censure, or which has received the slightest
mark of approbation from its opponents.”</p>

<p>(Incidentally we recall that the mode of procedure,
which is the Fifth Article, never received one word of
censure from any opponent on any ground, except that
it left <i>to government</i> the ability to reassemble the “conventions”
of the people. It was claimed that, even if
the people found the First Article power oppressive to
their individual freedom, government would never reassemble
their “conventions” for the purpose of permitting
them to withdraw any of those grants.)</p>

<p>Hamilton proceeded as follows: “It was desirable
that the sense of the people should operate in the
choice of the person to whom so important a trust was
to be confided.”</p>

<p>(We average Americans remember that the trust
of making or refusing new power to interfere with individual
freedom would always be infinitely more
important.)</p>

<p>“This end will be answered by committing the right
of making it, not to any preestablished body, but to
men chosen by the people for the special purpose, and
at the particular conjuncture.... A small number of
persons, selected by their fellow citizens from the general
mass, will be most likely to possess the information
and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.
It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder....
The precautions which have been so happily concerted
in the system under consideration, promise an
effectual security against this mischief.... And, as
the electors,” like the conventions for granting or refusing
national power, “chosen in each State, are to
assemble and vote in the State in which they are chosen,
this detached and divided situation will expose them
much less to heats and ferments, which might be communicated
from them to the people, than if they were
all to be convened at one time, in one place.”</p>

<p>(We recall Marshall’s echo of this in his later statement,
speaking of the Fifth and Seventh Article “conventions,”
“No political dreamer was ever wild enough
to think of breaking down the lines which separate the
states, and of compounding the American people into
one common mass. Of consequence, when they act, they
act <i>in</i> their states. But the measures they adopt do
not, on that account, cease to be the measures of the
people themselves, or become the measures of the state
governments.”)</p>

<p>Hamilton went on: “Nothing was more to be desired
than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed
to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most
deadly adversaries of republican government might
naturally have been expected to make their approaches
from more than one quarter.... But the convention
have guarded against all danger of this sort, with the
most provident and judicious attention. They have
not made the appointment of the President [or any
grant of new power to interfere with individual freedom]
to depend on any preexisting bodies of men, who
might be tampered with beforehand to prostitute their
votes; but they have referred it, in the first instance to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
an immediate act of the people of America, to be
exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and
sole purpose of making the appointment,” or a proposed
grant of new power to interfere with individual
liberty.... “Thus without corrupting the body of
the people, the immediate agents in the election [or the
grant] will at least enter upon the task free from any
sinister bias. Their transient existence, and their detached
situation, already taken notice of, afford a satisfactory
prospect of their continuing so, to the conclusion
of it. The business of corruption, when it is to
embrace so considerable a number of men, requires
time as well as means. Nor would it be found easy
suddenly to embark them, dispersed as they would be
over thirteen States [now forty-eight States] in any
combinations founded upon motives, which though they
could not properly be denominated corrupt, might yet
be of a nature to mislead them from their duty.” (<i>Fed.</i>
No. 68.)</p>

<p>If Hamilton had been alive to watch the supposed
legislative making of the Eighteenth Amendment, he
would have seen the manner of that supposed making
justify everything he said about the danger of letting
permanent government bodies have anything to do
with individual liberty, except the proper duty of each
legislature to make laws for its own citizens on matters
committed to that legislature by those citizens. And,
from what we have just quoted, the “constitutional”
lawyers of 1920 certainly should have known that,
when Hamilton was alive, he and his associates, by
their <i>mention</i> of those “legislatures” in the Fifth Article,
never subjected themselves and their posterity,
ourselves, to an omnipotent ability to do what those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
governments might will with our individual rights, “in
all matters whatsoever.”</p>

<p>It has been our custom, as average American citizens,
to rely upon our leaders to know and urge, at the
proper time and place, our protection under our American
Constitution. We have seen the danger of such
reliance in the record of our Congress of 1917. As
many of our leaders are most renowned lawyers, the
danger of that reliance is emphasized, if the briefs of
those leaders and lawyers in 1920 disclose that they
did not and do not know all these legal facts which
are so clear and also so essential to our protection as
American citizens. That we may ascertain whether
these briefs do disclose this ignorance and do emphasize
the danger of such reliance, we must later
examine the briefs themselves. But, that we may come
to such an examination, properly prepared, it is necessary
that we should know the nature of the litigations
before the Court and what were the arguments against
validity upon which the Court was asked to pass. In
no other way, can we acquire our own knowledge that
the Supreme Court has yet to hear and consider the
real challenge to the supposed new Article in which
governments attempt to exercise ungranted power and
to grant new power to interfere with the individual freedom
of the American citizen. As we well know, that
one real challenge is that the new Article was not made
by those who alone <i>can</i> make it, that it was not made
as it <i>can</i> be <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONALLY</span> made, by the makers
<i>of that kind of Article</i> named in the Fifth Article, the
“conventions” of the Seventh <i>and the Fifth</i> Articles,
the “We, the people” of the Preamble and “the
people” of the Tenth Amendment.</p>

</div>


<p>The validity of the Eighteenth Amendment (seven
litigations being heard together) was argued on
March 8, 1920, and for several days thereafter.</p>

<p>As we are not concerned with the meaning of the
second section of the Amendment or with the validity
of the Volstead Act (passed by Congress under the
grant of said section) except as the validity of the Act
depends upon the validity of the Amendment, we shall
make no mention of either.</p>

<p>The Court announced its decision, in all the litigations,
on June 7, 1920. Somewhat to the amazement
of the country, but (in our humble opinion even at the
time) very wisely, the Court refused to write any
opinion whatever. Nothing could more certainly settle
that the Court determined no question except the specific
questions presented by those who challenged
validity. That we may be certain that the Court
neither heard nor considered nor passed upon the real
and the invincible challenge to the existence of the supposed
new <i>national</i> Article, we will let the Court, in its
own words, state exactly just what were the four
propositions, advanced against validity, and state the
simple fact that it negatived each of those four propositions.
Thus, in an impressive manner, we shall
acquire our own knowledge that the fifth conclusion,
which later we shall state, is but the conclusion of fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
that nothing, in the four propositions negatived, impairs
the validity of the supposed Article.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Justice Van Devanter announced the conclusions
of the Court.</p>

<p>Power to amend the Constitution was <i>reserved</i> by Article
V, which reads:...</p>
</div>

<p>(As we have been in the conventions which made it,
we know it.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The text of the Eighteenth Amendment, proposed by
Congress in 1917 and proclaimed as ratified in 1919, 40
Stat. 1050, 1941, is as follows:...</p>
</div>

<p>(The text of the first two sections is quoted on page
465 herein.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are here concerned with seven cases involving the
validity of that Amendment and of certain general features
of the National Prohibition Law, known as the Volstead
Act, c. 83, 41 <i>Stat.</i> 305, which was adopted to enforce the
Amendment. The relief sought in each case is an injunction
against the execution of that act.... The cases have
been elaborately argued at the bar and in printed briefs;
and the arguments have been attentively considered, with
the result that we reach and announce the following conclusions
<i>on the questions involved</i>:</p>

<p>1. The adoption by both houses of Congress, each by a
two thirds vote, of a joint resolution proposing an amendment
to the Constitution sufficiently shows that the proposal
was deemed necessary by all who voted for it. An
express declaration that they regarded it as necessary is not
essential. None of the resolutions whereby prior amendments
were proposed contained such a declaration.</p>

<p>2. The two thirds vote in each house which is required
in proposing an amendment is a vote of two thirds of the
members present—assuming the presence of a quorum—and
not a vote of two thirds of the entire membership,
present and absent. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Kansas,
248 <i>U. S.</i> 276.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span></p>

<p>3. The referendum provisions of state constitutions
and statutes cannot be applied, consistently with the Constitution
of the United States, in the ratification or rejection
of amendments to it. Hawke v. Smith, ante, 221.</p>

<p>4. The prohibition of the manufacture, sale, transportation,
importation and exportation of intoxicating
liquors for beverage purposes, as embodied in the Eighteenth
Amendment, is within the power to amend <i>reserved</i>
by Article V of the Constitution. (National Prohibition
Cases, 253, <i>U. S.</i> 350, 384.)</p>
</div>

<p>We are not interested in the first two propositions
which the Court negatived. They were that the Congress
resolution should have <i>said</i> that two thirds of
Congress deemed it necessary to propose the Amendment
and that the proposals should have been made
by two thirds of the entire membership of the House
instead of two thirds of a quorum in each House.
These are trifling and unimportant matters when over
one hundred million Americans seek to learn when they
ceased to be citizens of America and became absolute
“subjects” of governments in America.</p>

<p>The third proposition negatived has naught to do
with ourselves, the citizens <i>of America</i>. It deals only
with the rights of some <i>state</i> citizens <i>as such</i>, where
their <i>state</i> constitution has a referendum provision.
For our protection against usurpation by any government
of our own reserved rights or powers, we look
to our own <i>American</i> Constitution. We have lived
through its making with the Americans who made it
to secure individual liberty of themselves and their
posterity, ourselves, the citizens of America.</p>

<p>The clear statement of simple fact, expressed in the
Court’s fourth conclusion, tells us something, which,
with Madison, we have known since he wrote and
suggested his Fifth Article, at Philadelphia, on September<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
10, 1787. Our stay in the “conventions,”
which made the Fifth Article, has taught us that the
Americans in them, even Henry and the opponents of
the Constitution, were fully aware of the fact that the
Fifth Article provided the <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode in
which the “conventions” could thereafter exercise the
existing omnipotence of the citizens of America themselves
to make any kind of an Article of government.
The same stay fixed firmly in our minds that every one
in them knew that the Fifth Article is not a grant of
any ability from themselves to themselves, from the
“conventions” named in the Seventh Article to the
same “conventions” named in the Fifth Article, all
being the “conventions” of the American citizens assembled
to exercise their own omnipotence.</p>

<p>And so, coming from the only “conventions” of that
kind yet held, we grasp at once the absolute accuracy
of the statement in the fourth conclusion of the Court
in 1920. The <i>mention</i> of the same “conventions” in
the Fifth Article, a mention made by the “conventions”
of the Seventh Article, is the sound basis for our
knowledge that, as the Tenth Amendment expressly
declares, those “conventions” of the Seventh expressly
<i>reserved</i> to themselves (the same “conventions”
named in the Fifth, “the people” of America in the
Tenth Amendment) their own exclusive ability to
make <i>national</i> Articles, like the First Article and the
Eighteenth Amendment. For which reason, we know
the truth of the Court statement in its fourth conclusion,
that the power to make the Eighteenth
Amendment “is within the power to amend <i>reserved</i>
by Article V.” The <i>exclusive</i> ability of the “conventions”
of 1787 and 1788—to make the Article which
is that new Amendment—is something known to all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
who were in those “conventions.” That the ability—to
make Articles like the First Article and the new
Amendment—<i>remained</i> exclusively in such “conventions”
of the American citizens, because such Articles
are <i>national</i> and either directly interfere with or are
the basis for direct interference with individual freedom
of the American citizen, was also known to every
one in those “conventions.” That is why the Americans
in those early “conventions” insisted that the Tenth
Amendment expressly declare that such exclusive
ability <i>was</i> reserved to them, “the people” of that
Amendment, and why the same “conventions” mentioned
themselves, the “conventions,” in the Fifth
Article and provided therein the <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span>
mode of procedure in which that exclusive ability could
thereafter be exercised by those who had it, the “conventions”
of the American citizens.</p>

<p>Even though this knowledge, which we bring
straight from the “conventions” which made the Fifth
Article, be not shared at all by the lawyers of 1920,
we are aware that it is also the knowledge of the
Supreme Court. That is why Marshall long ago
pointed out that, when individual welfare required that
government should be granted some <i>national</i> powers
or powers to interfere with individual freedom, “the
necessity of deriving such powers from the people
themselves was felt and acknowledged by all.” That
is why in 1907 the Supreme Court again declared “the
powers the people have given to the General Government
are named in the Constitution, and all not there
named, ... are reserved <i>to the people</i> and can be
exercised only <i>by them</i>, or upon further grant <i>from
them</i>.” As the First Section of the new Amendment
is the exercise and the Second Section is the grant of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
one of those reserved powers, and as the Fifth Article
provides the <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode of procedure in
which it can be exercised or granted by those, who
alone have it, “the people” of the Tenth Amendment
and the “conventions” of the Fifth Article, it is very
natural to read in the same Supreme Court, in the
National Prohibition Cases, that the ability to make
the Eighteenth Amendment “is within the power to
amend <i>reserved</i> by Article V.”</p>

<p>When the Supreme Court of Marshall’s day knew
that state “legislatures” could not make Articles like the
First Article and the Eighteenth Amendment, when
the Supreme Court of 1907 still knew that only the
“people” or “conventions” could make Articles <i>of that
kind</i>, when the Supreme Court of our own day knows
that the Fifth Article deals only with “<i>reserved</i>”
power, we Americans feel that we are to remain free
men and citizens. We have come from the “conventions”
with our own accurate knowledge that the power
to make the new Amendment or any other Article like
the First Article “is within the power to amend
<span class="allsmcap">RESERVED</span> by Article V.” But, for the very reason that
our knowledge is accurate, we know that the power
to make <i>such</i> Articles was <i>not</i> reserved to the state
legislatures, who did not have it, but <i>was</i> reserved to
the “conventions,” who did have it and who were exercising
it (in making the First Article) at the very
moment when they made the Fifth Article.</p>

<p>We have examined the four conclusions of the Supreme
Court which deal with any argument <i>presented</i>
against the existence of the Eighteenth Amendment.
Those conclusions negative every such argument that
was presented. But, because every brief assumed and
asserted that the amending power “<i>reserved</i>” in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
Fifth Article had been “<i>granted</i>” therein, the four
conclusions make clear that the Court has yet to hear
and pass upon the challenge which reads the Eighteenth
Amendment out of our Constitution. When
that challenge is presented by American lawyers, who
know what American basic law is and how American
citizens are constitutionally protected against usurpation
of power by governments in America, there can
be no doubt of the decision of the Supreme Court. In
<i>that</i> decision, there will be no conclusion denying the
most important legal fact in America, namely, that
<i>governments</i> cannot exercise ungranted power or create
new government power to interfere with the individual
freedom of the American citizen. In <i>that</i>
decision, there will be again the simple statement of
the undoubted fact that the ability to make the Eighteenth
Amendment “is within the power to amend
<i>reserved</i> by Article V.” But, in <i>that</i> decision, there
will be <i>added</i> the plain statement of the Tenth Amendment
that such ability was <i>not reserved</i> to the state
legislatures who never had it, but <i>was</i> reserved to the
“conventions,” who always had it and still have it.
And, comparing that future decision (which is certain
to come from the Supreme Court) with the decision,
which merely negatived the four unsound challenges
which <i>were</i> made to the Eighteenth Amendment, we
know that the first five conclusions of the latter decision—all
the conclusions that have aught to do with
the existence and validity of the Eighteenth Amendment—merely
hold that the existence of the new
Amendment is not affected by any of these challenges
which <i>were</i> made.</p>

<p>With exceeding wisdom in our humble opinion, the
Court carefully refrains from passing upon or determining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
any question except the exact challenges which
<i>were</i> presented. That is why no opinion was written.
When any general statement (seeming to bear upon
questions not presented or submitted) might come back
to perplex and annoy the Court in future litigation
where protected liberty of the American citizen was the
challenge to the government-made new Article, common
sense and sound reason and the experience of
generations dictated that no general statement should
be made. And, as there was but one way to avoid a
single general statement, no opinion was written. This
method of deciding those particular litigations, with
their four unsound challenges, would leave the decision
itself without even an apparent influence upon a litigation
in which some <i>real</i> challenge might be presented.</p>

<p>And so we find the Court merely stating “that we
reach and announce the following conclusions <i>on the
questions involved</i>.” Nothing could make more clear
that no conclusion is reached or announced on any
question not presented by those who urged invalidity.</p>

<p>The first four conclusions reached and announced
are conclusions of law against the opposite legal conclusions
urged by those opponents. The fifth conclusion
is a conclusion of fact that validity of the Amendment
is not affected by any of the four propositions advanced
by the opponents of the Amendment. In other words,
the first five numbered conclusions, all that deal with
validity of the Amendment, can be expressed in our
own words, viz: “Although the proposing Resolution
did not <i>state</i> that Congress deemed the proposal
necessary, although only two thirds of a quorum in
each House (and not two thirds of the membership of
each House) made the proposal, although the citizens
of each referendum state have not acted as part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
their respective state legislatures, and although it is
urged that the Fifth Article <i>reserved</i> abilities do not
include ability to make an Amendment like the Eighteenth,
we decide that none of <i>these</i> things affect the
validity of the new Article.”</p>

<p>And, when we make this accurate statement of what
was decided in those National Prohibition Cases, we
average Americans, fresh from our education with the
Americans who found themselves “subjects” and made
themselves and their posterity free men, have some
startling facts brought home to us.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly thousands of lawyers had worked, for
more than a year, in the preparation of the arguments
that were made and the briefs that were filed. When
these amazingly important litigations were reached,
the arguments lasted for several days. On the exhaustive
briefs filed against validity, there appear
twenty-two lawyers, many of them among the leaders
of the American Bar. On the briefs to support state
government omnipotence over the citizens of America,
“in all matters whatsoever,” thirty-five lawyers, headed
by a former member of the Supreme Court, appear.</p>

<p>We know, with a knowledge that brooks no denial,
because it is a knowledge brought from our experience
with those who made themselves free men and established
the Constitution to secure that result to themselves
and to us, that the new Article is not in the Constitution
unless at some time prior to 1917, the free
men of America, all the individual citizens of America,
became the “subjects” of <i>some</i> state governments.</p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that the existence of the
Eighteenth Amendment has always depended upon the
correct answer to the question whether the American
is “Citizen or Subject?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span></p>

<p>If we are subjects, the new Article <i>may</i> be in the
Constitution not made by us but made by governments.</p>

<p>If we still are citizens, as once undoubtedly we were,
the new Article <i>cannot</i> be in <i>our</i> Constitution, because
we have not made the new Article, assembled in our
“conventions.”</p>

<p>Where men are citizens, <i>governments</i> cannot exercise
ungranted power or create new power to interfere
with individual liberty.</p>

<p>In a nation of free men, established by former “subjects”
with a dominant purpose that no American
should ever be the “subject” of any governments, it is
amazing that one government should propose that
<i>governments</i> constitute, and it is amazing that forty-six
<i>governments</i> should attempt to constitute, new government
of men—new government power to interfere
with individual human freedom.</p>

<p>But most amazing of all, in a nation with the history
of America, is the fact that, when audacious government
had so proposed and audacious governments had
so attempted, the prolonged arguments and voluminous
briefs of fifty-seven leading members of the American
Bar never once knew or stated the simple fact which
made the proposal and the attempt a legal and constitutional
absurdity. The fact itself, the one most
important legal fact in America, was once known and
“felt and acknowledged by all” Americans. Yet, not
once in any brief in the National Prohibition Cases,
was it either known or urged that the “conventions”
of the Fifth Article are the “conventions” of the
Seventh Article and that both are the whole American
“people” of the Preamble and the Tenth Amendment
and that, therefore, the Constitution expressly <i>reserves</i>
to the “conventions” <i>of the Fifth Article</i>, the citizens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
of America, their existing and exclusive ability to create
new government power to interfere with their own individual
human liberty.</p>

<p><i>Why</i> none of these briefs did make this challenge
became known to us when Rice of Rhode Island, with
the silence of his colleagues marking their approval,
answered the Court that the new Article could not be
<i>constitutionally</i> made. <i>Why</i> they did not make the
challenge will be emphasized when we read the leading
brief against the new Amendment. Over fifty times
it will admit and state that the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a
“<i>grant</i>” of power to <i>state</i> legislatures from <i>American</i>
citizens and claim the “<i>granted</i>” power is a limited
power and does not include ability to make an Amendment
like the Eighteenth because such Amendment
takes away the reserved power <i>of a state or political
entity</i>. Then, to emphasize what it does not know
about the “conventions” of the Fifth Article and the
reserved powers of the citizens of America, this brief
will go on to tell us that there is no <i>constitutional</i> mode
in which can be made an Article which takes more
power away from any state; that such an Article may
only be made, outside any <i>constitutional</i> mode, by having
the people themselves rescind “the social compact”
which is their American Constitution and having them
make “such new compact as they please”; but that such
new compact, such new Article of that kind, cannot
“be validly and legally made to come to pass against
the objection and protest of <i>any</i> state.” All this clearly
explains <i>why</i> none of the briefers were able to answer
correctly the question asked by the Court. How
could they tell the Court in <i>what</i> way the Eighteenth
Amendment could be <i>constitutionally</i> made, when all
of them “knew” that there was no <i>constitutional</i> mode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
in which the “conventions” of the American citizens
could make it, and when they “knew” that it could not
be made, even outside the Constitution, without the
consent of the citizens of <i>every</i> state? The most important
words in the Fifth Article, “in conventions in
three fourths thereof,” did not mean to these briefers
what they meant to the Americans who made the Fifth
Article or to Madison and Hamilton who wrote the
Fifth Article and suggested it at Philadelphia. In
the word “conventions,” they did not recognize the
Seventh Article “conventions” of the American citizens
describing themselves by exactly the same word, “conventions,”
in the Fifth Article. In the words “in three
fourths thereof” after the word “conventions,” they
did not recognize the great security to human freedom
which we have learned with the Americans who wrote
and who made the Fifth Article. They did not recognize
how the American people, by these words, made
it <i>their</i> constitutional command that they themselves,
again assembled in their conventions, by a “Yes” from
three fourths of their “conventions” <i>and without</i> the
consent of the Americans in the other “conventions,”
might withdraw any power granted in the First Article
and might add any new power to its enumerated grants,
whenever <i>they</i> deemed such withdrawal or such addition
would better secure and protect American individual
liberty.</p>

<p><i>That</i> not one of the briefers <i>did</i> make <i>our</i> challenge
is our certain knowledge when we read the four challenges
they did make and which are negatived in the
first four conclusions of the Court.</p>

<p>The first two relate to the manner of the <i>proposal</i>
that governments create government of men in
America. Who cares <i>how</i> one government makes a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
silly <i>proposal</i>? The one important thing is that no
governments shall attempt <i>to act upon</i> a proposal
which denies the most important legal fact in America,
that <i>governments</i> cannot constitute new government
ability to interfere with individual liberty.</p>

<p>The fourth challenge that was made is the absurd
challenge that the Fifth Article does not <i>mention</i> a
<span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode of procedure in which the citizens
of America may again <i>directly</i> grant to <i>their</i>
government new power to interfere with their own
individual liberty and in which—far more important
to the “conventions” which named themselves (the
“conventions”) in their Fifth Article—the American
citizens can directly take back any part of the granted
power of the First Article which they find oppressive
to their individual liberty. This challenge neither
knows nor makes any distinction between the state
“legislatures” and the “conventions” of the American
citizens or the mention of either in the Fifth Article.
It is a challenge which has not the knowledge we bring
from the first “conventions,” the knowledge that “legislatures”
are mentioned on account of their existing
ability to make <i>federal</i> or declaratory Articles and that
“conventions” are mentioned on account of their exclusive
ability to make Articles <i>of any kind</i>. It is a
challenge which assumes and asserts and is based
wholly upon the absurd assumption that the Fifth Article
is a “grant” of power to make Articles. On this
absurd assumption of this patently absurd “grant,” this
fourth challenge, frankly stated in our own words, is
as follows: “In the Fifth Article, the ‘conventions’
grant to the two grantees—the grantors and the state
legislatures—an <i>identical</i> ability to make new Articles.
We admit that, if the ‘conventions’ of the Fifth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
Article could constitutionally make the Eighteenth
Amendment, the state legislatures can also constitutionally
make it. But our challenge is that the ‘grant,’
in the Fifth Article, is limited in extent and that neither
the ‘conventions’ nor the state legislatures can constitutionally
make the Eighteenth Amendment.”</p>

<p>To the “constitutional” lawyers who make this
challenge, to all who support such challenge, we commend
many hours’ study of the statements of Madison,
who wrote the Fifth Article; of Hamilton, who supported
its introduction at Philadelphia; of Wilson,
Pendleton, Henry, Iredell, MacLaine, Jarvis, Lee,
Mason, and the many others, with whom we have sat
in the “conventions” which made the Fifth Article.
Particularly do we commend a careful reading of the
reasoning which led to the decision at Philadelphia, in
1787, that the First Article, <i>because it constituted government
of men</i>, <i>must</i> go to the “conventions” named
alike in the Seventh and the Fifth Articles and could
not be validly made by the state “legislatures” named
in the Fifth Article. That decision was based upon the
unrepealed Statute of 1776, a statute well understood
in 1787, only eleven years after the Statute itself had
been enacted as the command of the whole American
people. Finally, to those who support this fourth
challenge, we commend a thorough reading of the law
laid down by Marshall in the Supreme Court. If they
thus educate themselves as we have educated ourselves,
they will be able to say with Marshall: “To the formation
of a league, such as was the Confederation, the
state sovereignties were certainly competent. But
when, ‘in order to form a more perfect Union,’ it was
deemed necessary to change this alliance into an effective
government possessing great and sovereign power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
and acting directly on the people, the necessity of referring
it to the people and of deriving its power
directly from them, <i>was felt and acknowledged by all</i>.”</p>

<p>And, if all shall complete their education with such
men as Webster and Lincoln, they will never again
make the mistake of ignoring the vital and important
distinction in identity between “state legislatures” and
“conventions” of the American citizens, the distinction
that the former are never anything but governments
and each the government agent of the citizens <i>of one
state</i>, while the “conventions” are the citizens of
America itself assembled in “conventions” to issue
their commands to themselves, to their government,
to the states and to the state governments. The completed
education will enable these lawyers to win future
litigation against legislative governments who audaciously
attempt to usurp the exclusive and reserved
powers of the “conventions” of the American citizens.</p>

<p>In any of the three challenges negatived by the first,
second and fourth conclusions of the Supreme Court,
we have failed to find any suggestion of <i>our</i> challenge,
namely, that state “legislatures” have audaciously attempted
to usurp the exclusive powers reserved to the
“conventions” which are named in the Fifth Article.</p>

<p>And now we examine the only other challenge that
<i>was</i> made, a challenge negatived by the third conclusion
of the Supreme Court. No challenge could
more emphatically ignore the protected individual
liberty of the citizen of America. This challenge does
not know that American citizens have <i>no</i> government
save the government of enumerated powers. This
challenge frankly admits that the Fifth Article is a
grant to legislatures, each elected by the citizens <i>of
some particular state</i>, and that three fourths of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
legislatures have the omnipotence, which was denied to
the British Parliament, over every individual liberty
of the American citizen. Like the other challenges
that <i>were</i> made, like every brief for or against the
Eighteenth Amendment, this challenge knows not that
the Constitution is both a <i>federal</i> and a <i>national</i> Constitution
and knows not that the state “legislatures”
never have and never can have aught to do with the
<i>national</i> aspect of that Constitution. Based on this
remarkable ignorance, this is the challenge, frankly
stated in our own words:</p>

<p>“The state legislatures <i>can</i> make this Eighteenth
Amendment. The state governments <i>can</i> do what they
will, so long as they call their action a constitutional
Amendment, with every reserved right and power of
the citizens of America. But thirty-six state legislatures
are necessary to make anything called a constitutional
Amendment. And our challenge is that thirty-six
legislatures have not made this particular Eighteenth
Amendment. In any state, where the referendum
exists, the citizens <i>of that state</i> [we note that
even now the citizens <i>of America</i> are not mentioned]
are part of the state legislature. In some of these
referendum states, whose legislatures are included
among your claimed thirty-six ratifiers for the Eighteenth
Amendment, the whole of the state legislature
has not yet ratified, because the citizens of the state,
who are part of its legislature, have not yet acted.
For this reason, that you ignore the rights of the
citizens <i>of some states</i>, our challenge is that the
Eighteenth Amendment has not been ratified by the
legislative governments of thirty-six states.”</p>

<p>This particular challenge, like everything in these
litigations and in the whole history of the supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
new Amendment, brings into bold relief the one monumental
error at the bottom of every thought that the
new Amendment <i>is</i> in the Constitution, at the bottom
of the varied absurdities which constantly appear in
every brief, either for or against validity.</p>

<p>Without a single exception, the fifty-seven lawyers
on these briefs base their every argument, no matter
how those arguments may challenge one another, on
the ridiculous sheer assumption that the Fifth Article
is a great power of attorney to the state governments
from the citizens of America. All these fifty-seven
lawyers ignore the undeniable fact—mentioned continually
in the “conventions” of the Seventh Article
which wrote their own name, “conventions,” into the
Fifth Article—that the Constitution is both <i>federal</i>
and <i>national</i>. This first mistake, this ignoring of that
fact, led all of them immediately into the fatal error
of wholly ignoring the vitally important fact that the
Fifth Article distinctly names those who already could
make <i>federal</i> Articles, the state governments, and
those whose exclusive right it always was and is to
<i>make national</i> Articles, the people assembled in their
“conventions.” Only because of these two mistakes,
the next step comes in the guise of the absurd concept
that the Fifth Article is a grant of <i>any</i> power of attorney,
from the citizens of America, either to the “state
legislatures” or the “conventions.” In this patent absurdity,
all fifty-seven lawyers concur. That each of
them does not see its patent absurdity is due entirely
to the fact that not one of them states the proposition,
that the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a grant, in the frankest mode of
stating it. That <i>frankest</i> way is to state the proposition
in these words: “In the Fifth Article the citizens
of America, assembled in the ‘conventions’ of 1788,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
<i>granted</i> to the state legislatures <i>and</i> to <i>themselves</i>, the
citizens of America, assembled in their ‘conventions,’ a
quantum of power as attorneys in fact of the citizens
of America. We fifty-seven lawyers only differ as to
the <i>extent</i> of the power which the citizens of America
grant to themselves and to the state governments.
We, who <i>support</i> the new amendment, contend that the
citizens of America grant to the state governments and
to the citizens of America <i>all</i> the power of the citizens
of America. On the other hand, we, who <i>oppose</i> validity,
contend that the citizens of America grant to
the state governments and to the citizens of America
only <i>some</i> of the unlimited power of the citizens of
America, the very power they were exercising when
they made the grant which is the Fifth Article.”</p>

<p>When the common proposition of all those lawyers,
that the Fifth Article “grants” power to those two
grantees, <i>is</i> stated in this frank way, its patent absurdity
is manifest. Every one of those lawyers knows
that a grantor never can or does grant to himself either
<i>all</i> or <i>part of</i> what he already has. Moreover, all
those lawyers ought to know that the Tenth Amendment
expressly declares that the entire Constitution,
in which is the Fifth Article, grants no power of any
kind except to the American government at Washington.
Alone and unaided, this simple declaration makes
it impossible that the Fifth Article grants any power
to the state governments. Thus, even without the
certain knowledge we bring from the conventions of
1788, the state governments disappear from the scene
as attorneys in fact for the citizens of America in any
matter. Each of those state governments is left with
no power it did not have before the Fifth Article was
made. Not one of them even keeps all of the power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
which it had before 1788. The citizens of America,
the “conventions” in which they assembled, commanded
otherwise. “When the American people created
a national legislature, with certain enumerated
powers, it was neither necessary nor proper to define
the powers retained by the States. These powers proceed,
<i>not from the people of America</i>, [the “conventions”
named in the Seventh <i>and the Fifth</i> Articles]
<i>but from the people of the several states</i>; and remain,
after the adoption of the Constitution, what they were
before, except so far as they may be abridged by that
instrument.” So spoke Marshall from the Supreme
Court Bench, in 1819, after he had come from one of
those “conventions” in which he himself had stated:
“It could not be said that the states derived any powers
from that system, [the new Constitution then before
the convention in Virginia] but retained them, though
not acknowledged in any part of it.” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i>
421.)</p>

<p>Yet every brief of those fifty-seven lawyers bases its
every argument on the sheer assumption, asserted by
all, that the Fifth Article is a “grant” to the state
legislatures which makes them attorneys in fact for the
citizens of America. No brief can offer and no brief
does offer the slightest proof in support of the assumption.
But no brief <i>asks</i> for proof of the assumption
or challenges the assumption. On the contrary, every
brief makes the assumption and asserts it and on it
rests every argument.</p>

<p>Because of this monumental error, every brief <i>for</i>
the Amendment insists that the state legislatures, as
attorneys in fact for the citizens of America with <i>every</i>
power of the citizens of America, validly made the
Eighteenth Amendment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span></p>

<p>Because of this monumental error, every brief
against the Amendment asserts that the state legislatures
are attorneys in fact for the citizens of America
but insists that the Fifth Article (the assumed power
of attorney in a Constitution which expressly declares
that <i>no</i> power is given to the state legislatures) grants
to the state legislatures (as well as to the “grantors”
themselves) only <i>limited</i> ability on behalf of the principal,
the citizens of America. On this altogether
unique argument, it is contended that the limited power
of attorney does not confer ability to make an Amendment
like the Eighteenth.</p>

<p>Because all briefs make the same monumental error,
there is no challenge on the ground that the state legislatures,
not a member of which is elected by the citizens
of America, hold <i>no</i> power of attorney from the
citizens of America to interfere in any way, in any
matter, with the individual freedom of the American
citizens. Because all briefs against the Amendment
make the same monumental error, the fourth challenge
(which <i>was</i> made and considered by the Court) is based
upon the heretical doctrine—the heresy being clear
from what we have heard in the “conventions” where
we sat—that the Fifth Article does not mention a
<span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode in which the citizens of
America, again assembled in their “conventions,” can
take back from their American government any enumerated
power of the First Article which they find
oppressive to their individual rights and freedom.
And, perhaps most amazing and amusing fact of all,
because all briefs make the same monumental error,
the briefs <i>for</i> the Amendment make no effort to support
and the briefs <i>against</i> the Amendment make no
attempt to challenge the clear paradox, on which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
Eighteenth Amendment depends for its existence, that
there never has been a citizen of America if it be true
that the Fifth Article makes the state governments the
attorneys in fact <i>for</i> the citizens of America with
<i>unlimited</i> ability to interfere with the individual freedom
of the citizens of America. Where such unlimited
ability <i>is</i> in government, men are not “citizens” but
“subjects.”</p>

<p>But we ourselves come from the “conventions”
where the Americans knew that they entered as free
men and left as citizens of America, not as “subjects”
of any governments. Therefore, we need no lawyer to
tell us—and no lawyer can deny our knowledge—that,
if the state governments are the attorneys in fact for
the American citizens and have ability either to interfere
with or to grant power to interfere with the
individual liberty of the American citizens, or, if <i>any</i>
governments can interfere with that liberty on a matter
not enumerated in the First Article, there never were
American citizens and the early Americans entered
their “conventions” free men but left those “conventions”
as “subjects” of an omnipotent government.</p>

</div>


<p>“Is the government of Virginia a state government
after this government is adopted? I grant that
it is a republican government, but for what purposes?
For such trivial <i>domestic</i> considerations as render it
unworthy the name of a legislature.” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i>
171.) So thundered Patrick Henry to the Americans
assembled in convention in Virginia, while these Americans
still heard the echo of his charge that the new
Constitution made the state legislatures “weak, enervated
and defenseless governments.”</p>

<p>But these are the governments which all lawyers of
1920 “knew” had been made the attorneys in fact for
the citizens of America, possessors of the supreme will
in America. These are the governments to which all
advocates of the Eighteenth Amendment contend that
the Americans, in the “conventions” with Henry, gave
the entire omnipotence of the American people to be
exercised by these governments, without any constitutional
restraint.</p>

<p>The real fact is, although all lawyers of 1920 failed
to know the fact, that these state governments were
only named in the Fifth Article, <i>because</i> they already
had an existing limited ability to make <i>federal</i> Articles,
an ability <i>not</i> granted by the citizens <i>of America</i> but
possessed by each of those governments as attorney in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
fact for the citizens <i>of its own state</i>. That it <i>was</i> an
ability not granted by the citizens <i>of America</i>, must be
apparent when we recall that it was exercised by those
governments in 1781—seven years before there was
such a thing as a citizen of America. That the lawyers
of 1920 neither knew nor realized the importance of
this fact, is apparent when we recall that every brief
of <i>those</i> lawyers asserted that these governments get
their ability to make Articles by a “grant” in the Fifth
Article.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the nature of <i>every</i> challenge to
the new Amendment, and our knowledge that each
challenge involved the assumption that the Fifth Article
<i>was</i> a “<i>grant</i>” to these state governments, is a
knowledge which is certain from our study of the conclusions
of the Supreme Court which negatived each
challenge.</p>

<p>The certainty is emphasized by our memory of the
reply of Rice in that Supreme Court, when, without
one dissent from the challengers, he stated his and
their conviction that the “conventions” of 1788—the
challengers all forgetting that those “conventions”
named <i>themselves</i> in the Fifth Article—provided no
<span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode of procedure in which their
own exclusive power could be again exercised to make
Articles like the First Article and the Eighteenth
Amendment.</p>

<p>Let us again emphasize our certainty by a few moments
with the briefs of the challengers.</p>

<p>Root was their leader. A distinguished public
leader and considered by many to be the leader of the
American Bar, there was special reason why <i>he</i> should
have known the ability of <i>government</i> to <i>make</i> national
Articles in a Constitution, <i>only</i> when men are “subjects,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
and the inability of <i>governments</i> to <i>make</i> such
Articles, when men are “citizens.”</p>

<p>If his brief, or the brief of any challenger, had
urged this real and invincible challenge, we would have
found the mention of that challenge in the decision <i>and
it would not have been a refutation of that challenge</i>.
That we may confirm our knowledge that the brief of
Root, <i>like the brief of every challenger</i>, did not make
this challenge, the challenge that the Fifth Article is
<i>no “grant”</i> but a <i>mention</i> of two existing abilities and
a mode of <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> procedure for the respective
exercise of each, let us read the brief’s own statements
of the three challenges it does make. “The
plaintiff contends that this attempted amendment to the
Constitution of the United States is invalid (1) because
it constitutes mere legislation, and is, therefore,
not authorized by Article V of the Constitution, (2)
because it impairs the reserved police or governmental
powers of the several States and their right to local
self-government, and (3) because it has not been ratified
by three fourths of the several States since it has
not been submitted to the electorate of the States in
which the initiative, or the referendum, or both, prevail
(assignment of errors Nos. 1-5). These questions
are discussed in points II, III, and IV, respectively.
In point I the prior amendments to the Constitution
are considered with reference to these contentions,
and in point V the justiciability of the
contentions is maintained.”</p>

<p>Its first challenge is itself the admission that all
<span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> ability to change our Constitution is
ability “<i>granted</i>” in the Fifth Article. Moreover, it
is the flat denial of any <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode of procedure
in which the citizens of America, by a “Yes”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
from three fourths of their assembled “conventions,”
can enact the legislation which is Section One of the
supposed Eighteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>Its second challenge is wholly on behalf of the political
entities, which are the states. It not only makes
no claim for the rights of American citizens, but it
denies any <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> ability in the American
citizens to interfere, by changing the American Constitution,
with what <i>the American citizens</i> reserved to
each state and <i>its citizens</i>.</p>

<p>The third challenge again fails to assert any claim
on behalf of the rights of the <i>American</i> citizens. It is
the challenge negatived by the third conclusion of the
Supreme Court. It is the challenge that the citizens
<i>of the State</i>, in some of the states, are part of the state
legislature.</p>

<p>If we want further confirmation of our knowledge
that this brief does not make the real challenge,
namely, that the Fifth Article is no grant to the supposed
grantors and the state governments, we find it
in the fact that the brief itself refers over fifty times
to the Fifth Article <i>as a “grant”</i> of limited ability to
make Articles.</p>

<p>If we need further confirmation, we find it in this
fact. After the Supreme Court had negatived every
proposition in that brief, its writers made application
for a reargument. The application was based on one
ground as far as concerned the <i>validity</i> of the Amendment.
That one ground was that the Court had
written no opinion. From this one fact, the claim was
made that the Court could not have considered the
potency of the three challenges which had been urged
in the brief. Educated with the earlier Americans, we
believe that each of these three challenges, in its very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
statement, shows why it is unsound, and that no
opinion was needed to explain its refutation. But the
nature of the application shows the continued concept
of the Fifth Article as a “grant.”</p>

<p>If we look at the other briefs against validity, we
will find all arguments based on the same monumental
error that the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a “<i>grant</i>” and that the
state legislatures are therein named the attorneys for
the citizens of America, although the latter, <i>as citizens
of America</i>, never elect a single member in those legislatures
and the Tenth Amendment expressly declares
that the Constitution gives no power of any kind to
the states or their legislatures. On the impossible
hypothesis of this monumental error are budded the
most extraordinary arguments.</p>

<p>In more than one brief, it is urged that, in the Fifth
Article, the whole people of America made a certain
number of state legislatures their own attorneys in
fact to amend the <i>American</i> Constitution. But, urges
the brief, the <i>American</i> people have no power to
change the state constitutions, and “therefore, the
grantees,” the state legislatures, “cannot exceed the
powers of their principal, the people of the United
States.” And, the brief goes on, as the people of
America cannot change a <i>state</i> constitution, neither can
the attorneys in fact of that whole American people,
the state legislatures, change it. The ability of the
people or citizens of America and of “<i>their</i>” attorneys
in fact, the state legislatures, is only competent to
change the Constitution of the citizens of America.
But this Eighteenth Amendment changes the Constitution
of each state. Ergo, that change is clearly beyond
the power of the citizens of America and “<i>their</i>” attorneys
in fact, the state legislatures!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span></p>

<p>It will serve no useful purpose for us to dwell
further upon the briefs against validity. They all
show the universal conviction that the Fifth Article <i>is</i>
a “grant” and makes the state legislatures attorneys
in fact for ourselves, the citizens of America, who
elect not a single member in the state legislatures.
Naturally, as this fundamental error is the invincible
conviction of all counsel against validity before any
brief is written, none of those briefs mentions such
simple facts as the fact decided by the Supreme Court
in Barron v. City of Baltimore, 7 <i>Pet.</i> 243. That decision,
by John Marshall, decisively settled the legal
fact that the Fifth Article grants no power to the
state legislatures to make the Eighteenth Amendment.
<i>And</i>, as it also decisively settled that the Fifth Article
<i>does not give</i> the state legislatures <i>any</i> power whatever,
it destroys the absurd concept that the Fifth
Article makes the state legislatures attorneys in fact
for those who made the Fifth Article, the citizens of
America, the “conventions” of the Fifth Article and
the Seventh Article. But lawyers, who start to write
briefs with the certain (although false) “knowledge”
that the Fifth Article <i>does</i> make the state legislatures
attorneys in fact for the citizens of America, neither
know the meaning of that decision nor state the decision
and its meaning and its effect upon the Eighteenth
Amendment in the briefs which they write. The
decision is very clear. We have met it earlier in our
education herein. It will bear repetition right now,
when we find fifty-seven lawyers all “knowing” that
the Fifth Article (despite the declaration of the Tenth
Amendment) does give power to the state governments
and, by giving it, makes these governments attorneys
in fact for the citizens of America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span></p>

<p>Barron claimed that a state statute was void because
it came in conflict with the restriction imposed by the
Article which is the Fifth Amendment to the American
Constitution. If the restriction applied to the state
legislatures and their powers, the statute was clearly
void. Therefore, as Marshall pointed out, the Court
had but one question to solve, whether the American
Constitution (in which is the Fifth Article) granted
<i>any</i> power to the state governments. If it did, then
general restrictions in that Constitution, as they clearly
applied to all powers <i>granted</i> in that Constitution, applied
to the state governments. On the contrary, if
the Constitution granted <i>no</i> power to the state governments,
general restrictions in the Constitution would
not apply to the state governments. For which reason,
the decision of the case itself was to depend on one
thing alone, whether there <i>was</i> any power granted in
the entire Constitution to the state governments. If
there was not, the decision would be against Barron.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The question thus presented is, we think, of great importance,
but not of much difficulty. The Constitution
was ordained and established by the people of the United
States for themselves, for their own government, and not
for the government of the individual states. Each state
established a constitution for itself, and in that constitution
provided such limitations and restrictions on the powers of
its particular government as its judgment dictated. The
people of the United States framed such a government for
the United States as they supposed best adapted to their
situation, and best calculated to promote their interests.
The powers they conferred on this government were to be
exercised by itself; and the limitations on power, if expressed
in general terms, are naturally, and, we think,
necessarily, applicable to the government created by the
instrument. They are limitations of <i>power granted in the
instrument itself</i>; not of distinct governments, framed by
different persons and for different purposes.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span></p>

<p>It would have been impossible for Marshall to have
stated more plainly that the “instrument,” the Constitution
(which contains the Fifth Article), <i>grants no
powers whatever to the state governments</i>. On that
fact, the fact being the simple answer to the question
“of great importance but not of much difficulty,” Marshall
decided that the general restrictions (applying
only to powers <i>granted</i> in the Constitution) did not
apply at all to the state governments, to whom the
Constitution granted no power whatever.</p>

<p>And so we Americans, trying to find the “when”
and “how” (between, 1907 and 1917) we became subjects,
cannot find the supposed answer anywhere in the
briefs against validity. All that we do find of interest
to us, in those briefs, is that the briefers, either with
or without knowledge of the fact, are meeting a claim
that there never was an American citizen and that the
American people became “subjects” when they made
the Fifth Article on June 21st, 1788.</p>

<p>By reason of our education in the making of the
Fifth Article, we know the answer to the absurd claim.
The answer is one that cannot be denied unless there
are facts which we have not learned in our education.
Therefore, we go quickly to the briefs of those who
make the claim, those who upheld the existence of the
Eighteenth Amendment, to ascertain what are the <i>new</i>
facts on which they base their claim that there never
was an American citizen and that the Fifth Article
made the American people “subjects.”</p>

<p>These opponents were led by Hughes. In this litigation,
<i>he</i> should not have forgotten that there are
limits to the powers of every government in America.
In the following January, he appeared in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
Court, to prove that there is limit to the power of the
<i>supreme</i> legislature in America, the Congress.</p>

<p>That Congress had passed a statute, known as the
“Corrupt Practices Act.” In it, certain practices, at
federal primary and other elections, were prohibited
and made criminal offenses. His client had been tried
and convicted by a jury as guilty of one of these practices
in a primary election for the nomination to the
Senate of America. On the appeal to the Supreme
Court, Hughes urged that, as our American government
<i>is</i> a government of <i>enumerated</i> powers, <i>incidentally
a fact which his claim for the state governments
in the National Prohibition Cases flatly denies</i>.
Congress could not <i>validly</i> pass the statute, under
which his client had been convicted, unless the power
to pass a statute in that particular matter was found
in some enumerated power in the Constitution. The
Constitution clearly gave Congress power to pass laws
concerning “elections” for federal officers. But, urged
Hughes, the Americans of 1788, the “conventions” in
the Fifth and Seventh Articles, did not know anything
about “primary” elections. Therefore, urged Hughes,
Congress has not the power to make the same thing a
penal offense at “primary” elections, which Congress
can make a penal offense at the regular elections. By
a divided Court, this argument, based on the claim of
<i>limited</i> power in the <i>supreme</i> legislature to prohibit
what a candidate for Senator may do, was sustained
and the conviction was reversed.</p>

<p>It is amazing, therefore, to turn to the Eighteenth
Amendment brief of the same briefer, a few months
earlier, and to find him contending for his clients
therein, twenty-four governments of state citizens, an
absolute omnipotence to interfere with individual freedom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
of American citizens on every subject. And it is
startling to find, in this brief, audacious denial of any
right in the Supreme Court even to consider whether
these governments of state citizens have that omnipotence
over the American citizen.</p>

<p>In the case of the candidate for Senator, it was his
concept and his claim that the Supreme Court can decide
that the <i>supreme legislature</i> in America had not
the power to make a certain command to candidates
for seats in the American Senate. This is the doctrine
that the only government of the American citizens is
a government of enumerated powers. In the Eighteenth
Amendment litigation, the following is his contention,
that thirty-six governments of state citizens
(the <i>inferior</i> legislatures in America) have unlimited
power, without any constitutional restraint, to make
commands to the American citizens on any matter
whatsoever:</p>

<p>“We submit that the conception involved in the
bill of complaint, that an amendment duly submitted
by Congress on the vote of two thirds of each House,
and duly ratified by the legislatures of three fourths
of the States, is still subject to judicial review, and may
be held for naught through judicial action by virtue
of a process of implied restrictions upon the amending
power—restrictions which thus set up by judicial
decree would be unalterable by any constitutional
process—is a conception of the most extravagant
character and opposed to the fundamental principles
of our government. No principle of judicial action
can possibly be invoked for sustaining such an authority.
The propriety and advisability of amendments,
which are not prohibited by the express exceptions in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
Article V, are necessarily confided to those through
whose action the amendments are to be made.”</p>

<p>We are quite accustomed to have men like Anderson
maintain that governments of state citizens have outlawed
<i>for the citizens of America</i> a traffic which
Madison hoped would take deep root everywhere in
America, a rightful traffic by human beings “so recognized
by the usages of the commercial world, the laws
of Congress, and the decisions of courts.” (Leisy v.
Harden, 135 <i>U.S.</i> 100.)</p>

<p>When Americans were fighting on the battlefields
of the Revolution for human liberty, Walter Butler
stirred up the House of the Six Nations to make a
home attack. It was natural, therefore, when Americans
in 1918 were fighting on the battlefields of
Europe for human liberty, that Anderson and men of
his type should stir up the Houses of thirty-six nations
to make a similar home attack. Americans will probably
always have Butlers and Andersons to stir up
home attacks, when Americans are away on the battlefields.</p>

<p>But it is a grave matter when one who has sat on
the Bench of the Supreme Court later contends that
the Court has no ability even to review an attempted
effort of the legislatures of state citizens to command
the citizens of America on a matter not enumerated in
the First Article.</p>

<p>From the “conventions” of the early American citizens,
we bring the knowledge that it is the bounden
duty of the Supreme Court to determine that the
governments of state citizens have no power whatever
to interfere with the individual freedom of American
citizens in any matter whatsoever. From those “conventions,”
we bring the certain knowledge that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
main purpose of the establishment of the Supreme
Court, as one department of the only and limited government
of American citizens, was that the Supreme
Court might protect every individual liberty of the
American citizen from usurpation of power by all governments
in America.</p>

<p>Any concept to the contrary is the most Tory doctrine
ever stated as American law since July 4, 1776.
It is blind to the fact that, by the Constitution, the
whole American people, “in their aggregate capacity,”
created a new nation of men and set it above the existing
and continued federation of states; to the fact
that the whole American people made that Constitution
one with <i>national</i> Articles, relating to the government
of men, and with <i>federal</i> Articles, relating to the
government of states; and to the fact that the whole
American people knew and settled that only “conventions”
of themselves could make <i>national</i> Articles, although
state legislatures, as attorneys in fact for their
respective states, could make <i>federal</i> Articles; and to
the fact that the Tenth Amendment names two distinct
reservees of existing power, “the states respectively,”
who are the members of the subordinate federation,
and “the people,” who are the members of the supreme
nation of men; and to the fact that the Fifth Article
grants no power whatever but mentions the “state
legislatures,” who act for the members of the federation,
and the “conventions,” who alone can ever act
for the members of the supreme nation, when the
latter are to make a change in <i>their</i> part of the Constitution,
the <i>national</i> part.</p>

<p>But we find the brief of Hughes, like the briefs of
his associates, actually challenging any right of review
by the Supreme Court, when the attorneys in fact for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
the states and state citizens, although the states have
nothing whatever to do with <i>that</i> part of the dual Constitution
which relates <i>to the nation of men</i>, actually
attempt to change the quantum of power (to interfere
with their own individual freedom) granted by
the nation of men to their only government. His challenge
even goes to the extreme of boldly asserting that
the “propriety and advisability of amendments,” even
though they infringe upon the individual freedom of
the members of the nation of men, must be finally determined
by the governments of state citizens, which
have nothing to do with the nation of men which is
America. His challenge is that the Supreme Court is
powerless to protect the liberty of the American citizens
if thirty-six governments of state citizens decide
to interfere with that liberty in matters not enumerated
in the First Article.</p>

<p>The challenge is exactly the challenge of Lord
North to the Americans in 1775. It is exactly the
challenge which the British Parliament would make,
if we were still its “subjects.” As basic American law,
it is sheer nonsense.</p>

<p>When we remember the doctrine of this briefer, that
there <i>is</i> a limit to the right of our <i>supreme</i> legislature
to prohibit what a candidate for Senator may do, and
compare it with this new Tory concept that three
fourths of the <i>inferior</i> state governments can validly
interfere with every personal liberty of ourselves, we
have one or two questions to ask the briefer. Is it his
thought that the supposed citizens of America made
their Constitution with the sole intent that the personal
rights of candidates for Senators should be secure and
that the number of Senators from each state should
remain the same? Is it his thought that the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
citizens, from whose “conventions” we have just come,
having settled these amazingly important things about
Senators, then voluntarily granted omnipotence over
every individual freedom in America to a fractional
part of the inferior state governments, twenty-four of
whom he represented in the litigation of 1920? Is it
his thought that the whole American people have two
governments, one the government of enumerated
powers constituted in the First Article and the other
the government of unlimited power constituted in the
Fifth Article? Is it his thought that his inferior state
governments, although all members of all the state
governments collectively could not enact a statute interfering
in the slightest degree with the American
citizen, can issue any command whatever to the American
citizen, and that the citizens of America must obey
that command so long as the state governments call it
an Amendment of the American Constitution?</p>

<p>It is our own certain knowledge that, when governments
issue any command to the citizens of America
and the command interferes with individual freedom,
the maker of the command must show the grant of
power to make that particular command. It is the
Alpha and Omega of American law that no government
has any just power to make any command to the
citizens of America, except in a matter on which those
citizens themselves have given that government the
power to make that particular command. It is in the
primer of American constitutional law, that there is
no government <i>of the citizens of America</i>, except the
government at Washington, and that it has no power
to command the American citizen, interfering with his
individual freedom, <i>except</i> in the matters named in the
First Article. It is admitted by all, even by the writer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
of that brief and his colleagues, that the power to make
the command which is the First Section of the Eighteenth
Amendment, is not enumerated in that First
Article. When, therefore, this counsel for twenty-four
of the governments which made that command tells
us that, after his client governments (at the suggestion
of our government which could not make the command)
have passed upon the propriety and advisability
of the command, we cannot have the Supreme
Court even consider the ability of his client governments
to make the command, our indignation is
mingled with our mirth.</p>

<p>Our indignation need not be explained. Our mirth
comes when we think of our needless fear that something
might have happened between 1907 and 1917 by
which we became “subjects” instead of the citizens we
had been. Throughout our education we have always
known that, <i>if</i> the Eighteenth Amendment (a <span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span>
article made entirely by <span class="allsmcap">GOVERNMENTS</span>) is in
the Constitution, we are “subjects.” We have known
that no legislative governments, before 1787 <i>and after</i>
1776, could have made this general command to the
citizens of America, <i>because</i>, during those eleven years,
there was no citizen of America and there were no
governments in the world who could make any <i>general</i>
command to the American people, interfering with
their individual freedom on any subject. We have
known, with certainty, that, if the Americans in the
“conventions” (where we have sat) knew what they
were doing and the Supreme Court, for a century, has
known what they did, there were no governments in
the world, up to the year 1907, who could make that
command <i>to the American citizens</i>. We have gone
everywhere to find what happened, between 1907 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
1917, to change the American citizens into “subjects”
of the governments for whom this counsel appears.
Now, after the fruitless search elsewhere, we are reading
his brief to find out what did happen between 1907
and 1917. His plain answer, as we have already
sensed, is—“<span class="allsmcap">NOTHING</span>.”</p>

<p>Our mirth entirely dispels our indignation, when
we sense his full concept of the nature of that absurd
Fifth Article “grant” to his government clients. That
we may not mistake his concept, the most Tory concept
ever stated as law in America since 1776, he
explains it again and again in his briefs. It is his
concept that the absurd supposed “grant” gives to his
client governments, not one member of which is ever
elected by the citizens of America, unlimited and constitutionally
unrestrained power to interfere with the
individual freedom of the American citizen on every
matter or, as the Declaration of ’76 put it, in its complaint
against the English King and <i>his</i> legislature, to
legislate for us on all matters whatsoever.</p>

<p>And our mirth is not lessened when we read,
in this brief, John Marshall’s full statement of the
making of the Constitution (with the Fifth Article in
it) and John Marshall’s clear decision that it was all
made by the citizens of America, the “conventions”
of the Seventh and the Fifth Articles.</p>

<p>No statement of facts could ever be written, which
more absolutely destroys the concept that the state
governments have the omnipotence denied to the English
Parliament, than the quotation from John Marshall
which we read in this brief to support that concept.</p>

<p>Throughout the quotation, with which <i>we</i> are all
very familiar, Marshall points out that there is a vital
distinction, amazingly important to individual freedom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
between the ability of the “conventions” (named
by exactly the same name in the Fifth as well as the
Seventh Article) and the limited ability of the same
“legislatures” for which this counsel appeared in 1920.
In the quotation Marshall points out that, when the
American citizens are to make a <span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> Article,
like the First Article and the Eighteenth Amendment,
there is but one way in which they can make it “safely,
<span class="allsmcap">EFFECTIVELY</span> and wisely,” “by assembling in convention.”
That all of us, including that counsel of 1920,
may not find any excuse for an assumption that state
governments can ever make Articles <i>of that kind</i>,
Marshall dwells at length upon the <i>inability</i> of state
governments or any governments to make them or any
Article like them. He tells us that, when the <i>American</i>
people make Articles <i>of that kind</i>, in the only way
in which they can ever <span class="allsmcap">EFFECTIVELY</span> make Articles <i>of
that kind</i>, by assembling in “conventions,” “<i>they</i> act
<i>in</i> their states. But the measures they adopt do not,
on that account, cease to be the measures of the people
themselves or become the measures of the state governments.”
“From these conventions the Constitution
derives its whole authority.” “It required not the
affirmance, and could not be negatived, by the state
governments. The Constitution, when thus adopted,
was of complete obligation and bound the state sovereignties.”</p>

<p>Up to the last short sentence <i>we</i> have just quoted
from the decision so familiar to us, Hughes quotes
at length and without omission. Hughes is in Court
for those “state legislatures” and state sovereignties,
which Marshall’s decision finds to be legislatures and
sovereignties wholly inferior in ability to the “conventions”
of the American people, named in the Fifth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
and Seventh Articles by exactly the same name—“conventions.”
How does the great lawyer of 1920 find,
in this Marshall decision, support for the unique idea
that these state, governments are omnipotent over
every right of the American citizens who sit in those
“conventions”? His remarkable claim is that the
state governments he represents have omnipotent
ability to command or interfere with anything in
America, except one thing. It is his claim that these
governments have omnipotent ability to interfere with
the citizens of America, with the Constitution of
America, with the government of America, with anything
in America, <i>except</i> that they cannot interfere with
that one thing for which the Revolution was fought,
the Statute of ’76 enacted and the Constitution established.
In the view of Hughes, that one thing apparently
is the right of every state to have the same
number of Senators. Our indignation is entirely dispelled
when we realize that he sincerely believes this
nonsense. Our mirth is merely increased when we find
him quoting, at some length, this decision of Marshall,
evidently under the impression that the decision supports
the nonsense.</p>

<p>But, we wonder why, at the particular point which
we have reached in the Hughes quotation from Marshall,
the former puts “stars” instead of the next
paragraph in the Marshall decision? Certainly, when
the great lawyer of 1920 has such faith in the omnipotence
of his government clients over us their “subjects,”
it cannot be that there is anything in the missing Marshall
paragraph to disturb that faith! Yet, as we read
the missing paragraph, with which we are quite familiar,
doubt assails us. <i>Is</i> the great lawyer of 1920<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
sincere or does he know that the position of his clients
in relation to the Eighteenth Amendment is nonsense?</p>

<p>What is the missing Marshall paragraph with which
we are so familiar? Lo and behold! it is our constant
companion throughout our education in the days of the
early Americans. It is the paragraph in which the
Supreme Court, by Marshall, points out why the Philadelphia
Convention of 1787 found themselves compelled
to send their First Article, with its grant of
<i>national</i> power like the grant in the Eighteenth Amendment,
to the “conventions,” named in the Seventh and
the Fifth Articles, <i>because</i> the state governments, the
clients of Hughes, were known and recognized by
everybody to be without ability to make <i>national</i> Articles.
In other words, it is the paragraph in which
Marshall announces what we have learned so clearly
ourselves, that “to the formation of a league, such as
was the Confederation [to the making of <i>federal</i>
Articles] the state sovereignties were certainly competent.
But when ‘in order to form a more perfect
Union,’ it was deemed necessary to change this alliance
into an effective government, possessing great and
sovereign powers and acting directly on the people, the
necessity of referring it to the people [the conventions
of the Fifth and the Seventh Articles] and of deriving
its powers directly from them was felt and acknowledged
by all.”</p>

<p>We know this paragraph of Marshall’s, omitted
from the Hughes brief, to be the epitome of everything
that we have heard in the “conventions” which made
the Fifth Article. We remember that even Henry,
from the very fact that the “conventions” of the
American citizens <i>were</i> assembled, knew that the <i>then</i>
proposed Articles did grant power to interfere with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
human freedom. And we remember (because he knew
the inability of state governments ever to make such
grants) that, on the fact that “conventions” <i>were</i> assembled,
he based his charge that the proposed Articles
<i>were</i> <span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> and not <i>federal</i>. We remember that
the Tenth Amendment declares that the entire Constitution,
including the Fifth Article, gave no power of
any kind to those state governments. And so we know,
what Henry knew, that the state governments did not
<i>have</i>, and that <i>the Fifth Article did not give them</i>, any
ability to make <span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> Articles, like the First Article
and the Eighteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>For which reason, we cannot (looking at the matter
purely from the standpoint of lawyer’s attitude to his
government clients) blame Hughes for putting the
stars in his quotation from Marshall.</p>

<p>Eager to remain free citizens, eager to have all governments
recognize that we are not “subjects,” we
ourselves commend, to the writer of that brief and to
all who uphold the Eighteenth Amendment, the entire
decision of Marshall in M’Culloch v. Maryland. For
instance, we commend this clear statement of basic
American law:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If any one proposition could command the universal
assent of mankind [except those <i>for</i> the validity of the
Eighteenth Amendment], we might expect it would be
this:—That the government of the Union, though limited
in its powers, is supreme within its sphere of action. This
would seem to result necessarily from its nature. It is
the government of all; <i>its powers are delegated by all</i>; it
represents all, and acts for all. Though any one state may
be willing to control its operations, <i>no state</i> is willing to
allow <i>others</i> to control them. The nation, on those subjects
on which it can act, must necessarily bind its component
parts.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span></p>

<p>Among other things, this statement, itself but a
repetition of everything that we have learned by our
experience with early Americans, emphasizes the important
fact that the nation, which is ourselves, has
but one government, the government “limited in its
power.” Which fact clearly demonstrates that the
state governments, not being that one government of
“limited powers,” are not the attorneys in fact for the
citizens of <i>America</i>, in any matter whatsoever, and
cannot command us, as they attempt to do in the First
Section, or grant power to command us, as they attempt
to do in the Second Section of the Eighteenth
Amendment.</p>

<p>Again this same decision of Marshall holds clearly:
“In America, the powers of sovereignty are divided
between the governments of the Union and those of
the State.” The claimed ability of the Hughes government
clients, their claimed ability to <i>make</i> the
<span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> new Article in our Constitution, rests entirely
upon the absurd doctrine that, <i>above</i> the two
sovereignties which Marshall names, there is an omnipotent
legislative sovereignty, without any constitutional
restraint, the sovereignty of three fourths of the
very state governments which Marshall mentions.</p>

<p>In the same M’Culloch v. Maryland, Marshall pays
a tribute to an accurate knowledge, which we have
acquired in our education with the early Americans.
It is the knowledge that everything in the Constitution
denies any ability in even all the states <i>as such</i>, or in
all the state governments, each of which is never anything
but a government of the citizens of <i>one</i> state
and <i>their</i> attorney in fact as <i>state</i> citizens, to alter in
any way the <span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> part of <i>our</i> Constitution (which
Constitution is both <i>national</i> and <i>federal</i>) because the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> part relates to direct interference with the
individual freedom of the <i>American</i> citizens. This is
his tribute to the truth of the knowledge which we have
acquired. He says that there is “a principle which so
entirely pervades the Constitution, is so intermixed
with the materials which compose it, so interwoven
with its web, so blended with its texture, as to be incapable
of being separated from it without rending it
into shreds. This great principle is, that the Constitution
and the laws made in pursuance thereof are
supreme; that they control the Constitution and laws
of the respective states and cannot be controlled by
them.”</p>

<p>And so we average Americans find naught but encouragement
in the brief of Hughes. From its
quotations, from its every statement, we learn that we
have known all the facts, before we read it, and that
we are free citizens and not “subjects.” In that brief
of the champion of champions of the governments that
“made” the new <span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> Article, we learn that there
are no new facts on which to base the claim that we,
the whole people of America, have another government
besides the government of enumerated powers,
the claim that we are “subjects” and that our new
omnipotent Parliament wears the aspect of thirty-six
inferior governments, each elected by the citizens of
a nation which is not America.</p>

<p>In the brief of this champion, we find no pretense
that there is any support for this weird claim. On the
contrary we find the whole claim depending entirely
upon the sheer assumption—asserted as if to state it
was to state an axiom—that the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a
“grant,” wherein the “conventions” grant <i>to the
grantors</i> and to the state governments ability to exercise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
omnipotence over the American citizens, ability
to interfere with their individual freedom, in any
matter whatsoever.</p>

<p>In his brief, Hughes emphatically asserts the truth
that “the people never become a legislature.” Yet, the
basis of his whole argument is that what “the people”
of the Tenth Amendment expressly reserved to themselves
may be given away by the “legislatures” of the
states, although the “states” are an entirely different
reservee in the Tenth Amendment. He does not know,
what all knew when the Fifth Article was made, that
the “conventions,” who made it and who are named
in it, meant “the people” themselves. He does not
know the tribute of Madison, in the Virginia convention
which ratified the Fifth Article, to the American
“conventions” in which the people themselves directly
constituted new government of men; “Mr. Chairman:
Nothing has excited more admiration in the world
than the manner in which free governments have been
established in America; for it was the first instance,
from the creation of the world to the American Revolution,
that free inhabitants have been seen deliberating
on a form of government, and selecting such of
their citizens as possessed their confidence, to determine
upon and give effect to it.” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> p. 616.)</p>

<p>Hughes does not know, as Story did, that the drafter
and the makers of the Fifth Article put into it the
lessons of their own experience in the making of
<i>national</i> Articles, by the “conventions” of 1776, and
in the making of <i>federal</i> Articles by the state “legislatures”
between 1777 and 1781. “It is wise, therefore,
in every government, and especially in a Republic,
to provide means for altering and improving the fabric
of government as time and experience or the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
phases of human affairs may render proper to promote
the happiness and safety of the people. The great
principle to be sought is to make the changes practicable,
but not too easy; to secure due deliberation
and caution; <i>and to follow experience</i>, rather than to
open a way for experiment suggested by mere speculation
or theory.” (2 Story on the Constitution,
Sec. 1827.)</p>

<p>For all of which reasons, Hughes and his associates,
although they might be certain that the people never
became the legislature, were not aware that, to the
Americans who made the Fifth Article, its “conventions”
<i>were</i> “the people” of the Tenth Amendment.</p>

<p>Naturally, we are not surprised to find a briefer who
ignores this fact, possibly the legal fact in America
most important to individual liberty, also indulging in
the monumental error of the thought that these “conventions,”
in their Fifth Article, made a grant, to <i>themselves</i>
and to his clients, of equal omnipotence over
themselves, the citizens of America. We recognize
that, if the Article was such a grant to his clients, the
grant would have been the greatest grant ever made
in the history of mankind. We recognize that it would
have been a grant by three million free men, four years
after the war by which they had become free men,
surrendering to governments absolute control of every
individual liberty and making themselves absolute
“subjects.”</p>

<p>We know that Hughes <i>did</i> maintain that the one
government created by or given any power in the Constitution,
in which is the Fifth Article, had not power
to forbid a candidate for Senator to do what he did.
It is interesting and instructive to know that the same
lawyer holds, as an axiom which needs no proof, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
the same Constitution gave unlimited ability to his
client governments to interfere with every individual
liberty of the Americans who are not candidates for a
Senatorship.</p>

<p>We have the word of the man who wrote the language
of that Fifth Article that it is merely “a mode of
procedure” in which may be exercised either the existing
unlimited ability of ourselves in “conventions” or
the limited ability of the state governments to make
<i>federal</i> Articles. <i>We</i> recognize, no one who reads it
could recognize otherwise, that the Fifth Article, outside
of two exceptions to <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> exercise of
existing abilities to make Articles, contains nothing but
procedural provisions. This knowledge we brought to
the reading of the Hughes brief, after we had acquired
the certainty in our education with the Americans who
made the Fifth Article. Then we read this brief of
the champion of champions for the validity of the
supposed new Article and found therein the sheer
assumption, as an axiom which needed no proof, that
the Fifth Article, with nothing but its procedural provisions,
was a grant of omnipotence to his government
clients over ourselves!</p>

<p>Imagine, therefore, our amazement <i>and our amusement</i>,
in the same brief, to find this clear echo of the
statement of Madison and of our own knowledge, this
accurate and complete statement of exactly what the
Fifth Article contains: “Article V, <i>apart from procedural
provisions</i>, contains two limitations of the
power to amend, as follows: ‘Provided that no Amendment
which may be made prior, etc.’”</p>

<p>If, “<i>apart from procedural provisions</i>,” the Article
has nothing but “two limitations” of existing abilities
to make Articles, where does he or anyone find in it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
the greatest “grant” known to the history of mankind?</p>

<p>When this briefer made his argument for his client
who had been a candidate for Senator, he had no attack
to make upon the <i>procedure</i> in which Congress had
passed the Corrupt Practices Act. When he went to
ascertain whether Congress had the power to make
that command, about “elections,” he did not look for
the power in any “procedural provisions,” which prescribe
<i>how</i> Congress should exercise its ability to make
commands.</p>

<p>If this briefer or any lawyer were asked, on behalf
of a client, to accept a bill of sale from an <i>alleged</i>
attorney in fact of the owner of a cow, he would not
seek, in any procedural provisions which prescribed
<i>how</i> an attorney in fact can execute an instrument for
his principal, to find the authority of the alleged attorney
to sell the cow.</p>

<p>Why then, in an Article with naught but procedural
provisions and two limitations on power to make
Articles, do he and all his associates seek to find, <i>and
assert that they do find</i>, grant of authority to the inferior
governments of state citizens to give away
every liberty which the citizens of America hold most
dear?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br><span class="small">CITIZEN OR “EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT”?</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It is our invincible knowledge that the Fifth Article
is not a power of attorney to any one to act for
us, the citizens of America, in regard to any individual
right which the <i>American</i> citizen has. In our capacity
as American citizens and in “conventions” of the very
kind named in that Fifth Article, we gave the only
power of attorney, which we have ever given to any
government to act for us in making commands to interfere
with any of our individual rights. That power
of attorney is the First Article. We made it in the
same “conventions.” In it, we gave to our Congress
our only power of attorney <i>of that kind</i>. In it, with
futile effort to keep modern “constitutional thinkers”
from monumental error, we said, at the very beginning
of the one Article which is our only power of attorney,
that to our Congress alone the Constitution gives any
powers to make commands that interfere with our
individual rights. “All legislative powers herein
granted shall be vested in a Congress, etc.” (Art.
I, Section <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> <i>U.S. Cons.</i>)</p>

<p>In those same “conventions” (named in the Fifth
Article) we insisted, again in futile effort to keep
modern “constitutional thinkers” from monumental
error, that there be written the exact declaratory statement
that the entire Constitution gave no power (to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
act for us, the citizens of America, in any matter) to
any donee except our new general government, the
government of the First Article enumerated powers.
And, in those “conventions,” we insisted that there be
written into that Constitution the accurate declaratory
statement that all powers to act for us in any matter,
except the powers <i>of that kind</i> we gave to that one
limited general government, we retained exclusively to
ourselves, the citizens of America, that they might be
exercised only <i>by ourselves</i> or upon further grant <i>from
ourselves</i>. Those two important declaratory statements
were written into that Constitution in the shape
of the Tenth Amendment.</p>

<p>That we ourselves might have a <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span>
mode of procedure in which <i>constitutionally</i> we could
make that future exercise or further grant of those
powers which we reserved to ourselves, we named ourselves—the
“conventions” of the kind in which we
sat—in the Fifth Article and provided therein the
<span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> mode in which we <i>could</i> again do
exactly what we were then doing in the same kind of
“conventions.” It was impossible for us in those conventions,
“being a people better acquainted with the
science of government than any other people in the
world,” to anticipate that modern “constitutional
thinkers” should make the ludicrous mistake of inferring,
from that mention, that we—the “conventions”—granted
to ourselves—the “conventions”—all
or some of the very power we were then exercising in
those “conventions.” Nor did we anticipate, inasmuch
as <i>we</i> (in those “conventions”) never forgot that this
new Constitution was to be <i>federal</i> as well as <i>national</i>,
that modern “constitutional thinkers” would make another
monumental error in assuming that a similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
<i>mention</i> of the existing ability of state legislatures (the
ability to make <i>federal</i> or declaratory Articles) was a
<i>grant</i> to those governments of our own power to make
<i>national</i> ones. Even if we had possessed (in those
“conventions”) the vision to see the future that was
1920, we would have felt that the Statute of ’76, the
opening words of the First Article and the explicit
declarations of the Tenth Amendment made any such
error impossible for modern “constitutional thinkers.”</p>

<p>Yet, one or more of such errors are the basis of
every argument in every brief of the fifty-seven lawyers
of 1920.</p>

<p>They are the basis of the Root briefs and the other
briefs <i>against</i>, as they are the basis of the Hughes
briefs and the other briefs <i>for</i>, the validity of the supposed
new Amendment. Not a single one of the briefs
fails to <i>assume</i>, without the slightest foundation, that
the state governments, not a member of which is
elected by the citizens of America, <i>are</i> attorneys in fact
for the citizens of America. Wherever one brief
differs from another in this respect, it is only in urging
some difference in the extent of the power of attorney
made to those governments by the citizens of America
in the Fifth Article.</p>

<p>For which reason, we, who have come from the days
of those early Americans, strong in the knowledge that
we are citizens and not “subjects,” are now satisfied
that none of these modern “constitutional thinkers”
can disturb our certain knowledge. It is a matter of
no concern to us that some of them, because they did
not have our knowledge, failed to win their litigations
for their clients. It is, however, a matter of great
concern to us that supporters of the Eighteenth
Amendment should be found maintaining, as if it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
an axiom needing no proof, that we are “subjects” of
the governments they represented.</p>

<p>We need spend very little further time in the briefs
of those who so maintain. We have no patience with
their Tory concept of the relation of men to governments.
We <span class="allsmcap">KNOW</span> that Tory concept never has been
American law since the Statute of ’76. But it would
not be proper to leave their briefs without one glance
at some of their heresies, which are flatly contradicted
by everything we have learned in our education. As
a matter of fact, not one of these heresies can stand
accurate and simple statement without exposing its own
absurdity.</p>

<p>Some of us are familiar with the book known as
“The Comic Blackstone.” We have thought of it often
as we read the briefs of those <i>for</i> validity of the new
Amendment—the government constitution of government
power to interfere with the individual freedom
of American citizens. There is, however, a vital difference
between the book and those briefs. The book
was a conscious effort to be humorous. Unconscious
humor has never failed to surpass conscious and intended
humor.</p>

<p>We recall our search to know “when” and “how,”
between 1907 and 1917, we became subjects. We remember
the first glance at the briefs of 1920. We
remember the tribute of one to the simple truth that
“the people do not become a legislature.... As
well confound the creator and the creature—the principal
and the agent through which he acts.” We
wonder why the author of this tribute did not challenge
the monumental error of the concept that the Fifth
Article (when it mentions the “conventions” of the
American citizens, the greatest principal in America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
and also mentions the state governments, each as the
attorney in fact of another and distinct principal, the
citizens of its own state) is a grant from the great
principal to itself and these mentioned attorneys in
fact of others. But we now know why the author of
the tribute made no such challenge. He is Hughes,
who rests his entire argument <i>on</i> the monumental
error. We remember, as we glance at the briefs, that
another one challenged the doctrine on which Sheppard
proposed that the Eighteenth Amendment be
sent to governments of state citizens, that such governments
might interfere with the freedom of <i>American</i>
citizens. We remember the Sheppard doctrine as the
Calhoun heresy that the states, political entities, made
the Constitution which <i>we</i>, the citizens of America,
actually made in our “conventions.” We remember
how refreshed we were to find, in our first glance at
the briefs, this statement: “The Constitution is not a
compact between states. It proceeds directly from the
people. As was stated by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall
in M’Culloch v. Maryland, 4 <i>Wheat.</i> 316, &amp;c.” We
remember our thought, when we had just come from
those “conventions,” to find this statement in that
brief. We remember how we anticipated this briefer
telling the Court why the states or <i>their</i> governments,
who could not make the First Article, were incompetent
to make the only other supposed grant of power
to interfere with our liberty, the Eighteenth Amendment.
Now that we have finished with the briefs of
1920, we recognize how absurd was our expectation.
The statement that the states, which are mere political
entities, did not make the Constitution, the quotation
from Marshall, supporting this truth and showing that
the states did not make it because the states and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
governments cannot make <i>national</i> Articles, are both
from the brief of this same Hughes, the champion of
his government clients and their claimed ability to
make <i>national</i> Articles.</p>

<p>We find some considerable amusement in comparing
the speech of Sheppard, proposer of the Eighteenth
Amendment, and the brief of Hughes, champion of
the Eighteenth Amendment. If government was to
carry through a successful revolution against free men
and acquire the omnipotence denied to the British Parliament,
it would have been well for the proposers of
the Revolution and the champions of it to have agreed
at least upon one fact, whether the states, political
entities, or the citizens of <i>America</i>, in <i>their</i> “conventions,”
made the Constitution—which was to secure
the American citizen against all usurpation of power
by governments.</p>

<p>But, once we sense the certainty that this revolution
of government against free citizens <i>cannot</i> be successful,
once we realize the certain decision of the Supreme
Court when the real challenge is made to the disguised
revolution, we can forget the attempted tragedy of
human liberty. Then we shall know that the entire
story of the last five years is an inexhaustible mine of
humor. And, among the briefs of those who championed
this revolution of government against human
being, we shall find no mean rival (in unconscious
humor) to any other part of that story.</p>

<p>We recall, at our first introduction to all the briefs,
the epitome of all the knowledge we had just brought
from the early conventions: “There is only one great
muniment of our liberty which can never be amended,
revoked or withdrawn—the Declaration of Independence.
In this regard, it ranks with the Magna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
Charta.” We recall how pleased we were to know
that the Court must hear another champion of individual
liberty, who also must have come from the
“conventions” in which we had sat. We recall how,
in his brief, this truthful tribute to the Statute of ’76
was immediately followed by the quotation from that
Statute, which includes these words: “That to secure
these Rights, [the Rights of men granted by their
Creator] governments are instituted among men, deriving
their just powers from the consent of the governed.
That whenever any Form of Government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the
<i>People</i> to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new
government, laying its foundation on such principles
and organizing its powers in such form, as to <i>them</i>
shall seem most likely to effect <i>their</i> Safety and
Happiness.”</p>

<p>In our eager anticipation to hear his argument and
see his brief, how were we, fresh from the “conventions”
in which sat some of the men who had written
that Statute eleven years earlier, to know that the
briefer understood their language to read as follows:
“That to secure these rights of human beings, granted
by their Creator, governments are instituted among
men, deriving their just powers from the consent of
<i>the state governments</i>. That whenever any Form of
Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is
the right of <i>the state governments</i> to alter or abolish
it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation
on such principles and organizing its powers in
such form as to <i>the state governments</i> shall seem most
likely to effect the welfare of those who control the
state governments.”</p>

<p>That this <i>is</i> the meaning of that Statute to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
briefer, we may realize when we know that the tribute
to the Statute and the quotation from the Statute are
in the brief of Wheeler, counsel for the political organization
which managed the new revolution of government
against people and dictated the proposal that
governments should constitute new government of men
in America. Now we grasp why this briefer said that,
in the fact that the Declaration of Independence could
“never be amended, revoked or withdrawn,” the
Statute of ’76 “ranks with the Magna Charta.” To
this briefer, the Statute of ’76, like the Great Charter
of old, is the ruler government dispensing privileges
to its subjects, the people. That is why this briefer,
with his Tory concept of the relation of government
to human beings, does not know that the Statute of
’76 <i>is</i> the revocation of the principle on which Magna
Charta rested, the doctrine that the government is the
State and the people are its assets.</p>

<p>This briefer, <i>like all his associates</i>, does not know
the great change which the American people made in
the picture of American government. We are all familiar
with the picture, “His Master’s Voice.” When
those Americans were born, from whose “conventions”
we have come, the listener in that picture was “the
people” of the Preamble and the Tenth Amendment
in our Constitution. The voice of the master was the
voice of government. When those Americans died,
<i>they</i> had changed the picture. The listener had become
the governments in America, the voice of the master
had become “the people” of America, its citizens. The
new painting of the picture was on July 4, 1776.
That the listener might never deface the truth of the
new picture, the Constitution of 1787 was proposed
at Philadelphia and later made by the master in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
picture. The proposal of Wheeler and his associates
and the action of governments on that proposal are
the unlawful attempt to change the picture back to
what it had been before the Statute of ’76.</p>

<p>If time permitted, our sense of humor would keep
us long with the briefs of Wheeler and his associates.
It was their thought that the doctrine of Christ could
be made a better Christianity by a substitution of the
prohibition of Mohammed for the temperance of
Christ. This natural modesty on their part made
certain that we would find, in the Wheeler brief, this
tribute to the good <i>intentions</i> of the Americans of
those early “conventions,” accompanied by an humble
tribute to the much greater wisdom of the briefers.
“The people, under this form of government may, of
course, do unwise things. This is the alleged danger
of a republican or democratic form of government.
If the electorates are not intelligent, moral and patriotic,
our government will fail. Our forefathers took
that chance in choosing a form of government that was
controlled entirely by the people. History proves that
they builded more wisely than they knew. The people
have kept step with advancing civilization under the
same construction of our Constitution. This last advance
in the prohibition of the beverage liquor traffic,
which is one of the greatest evils that ever cursed
humanity, is additional evidence of the wisdom of our
forebears. It is generally recognized as the greatest
piece of constructive legislation that was ever adopted
by a self-governing people.” The finest passage in
the “Comic Blackstone” does not approach this in its
excellence as unconscious humor.</p>

<p>Educated with “our forefathers” who “took that
chance in choosing a form of government that was controlled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
entirely <i>by the people</i>,” we call the attention of
Wheeler to one of his many mistakes by rewriting his
next sentence, as he should have written it: “History
proves that they builded more wisely than Wheeler or
his associates knew or are able to understand.”</p>

<p>Our forefathers knew that, wherever men are citizens,
neither state governments nor any governments
are “the people” or can surrender rights of “the
people” or can constitute new governments of “the
people” interfering with their individual freedom and,
therefore, when those “conventions” of old did choose
and establish a form of government “that was controlled
entirely by the people,” they were not stupid
enough to think that the American government would
be <i>that kind</i> of a government if it could be controlled
entirely by legislatures, which never are the people. It
is rather ridiculous to find Hughes, associate champion
of Wheeler for the new Amendment, contending that
the people never are the legislature, while Wheeler contends
that a government is controlled entirely by the
people when it is controlled entirely by legislatures.
But, it is to be expected, when men work in association
on a common <i>unsound</i> basis, that one champion should
frequently contradict another as to fact, and that even
the same champion should often contradict himself as
to fact.</p>

<p>And so we find the Wheeler brief stating that the
new Amendment, made entirely by governments without
any authority from the people about whom he
prates, “is generally recognized as the greatest piece
of constructive <i>legislation</i> that was ever adopted by a
self-governing people”; and we turn over the pages
of the brief and we find the remarkable proposition
that these state legislatures, when making the Eighteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
Amendment, were not <i>legislating</i>, but were
“a body of representatives sitting in a conventional
capacity.” Of course, we now learn, by this latter
statement, that the greatest piece of “constructive
legislation” the world ever knew was not legislation
at all. But we also learn a more important thing. It
would have been of great advantage to the British
Parliament in 1765, if it had only known the Wheeler
concept of our American security for human freedom.
Think how remarkable it would have been to have
passed a Stamp Act which would have been universally
respected and obeyed by the American people of that
time! All the British Parliament should have done
was to announce: “This is not passed by us as a legislature.
In issuing this command to the American
people, we are a ‘body of representatives sitting in a
conventional capacity.’” Having exactly the same
attitude mentally as Lord North in 1775, this Wheeler
would have been a better Minister for the English
King. He would have been able to keep for him the
American “subjects” of the British Legislature.</p>

<p>“Article V itself shows that the representative or
convention idea was in the minds of the framers of the
Constitution. If the legislatures of two thirds of the
states should apply to Congress, then Congress would
be obliged to call a convention for proposing Amendments
to the Constitution. Then, also, when it came
to the matter of ratification, this question could be
considered by conventions in the various states. A
review of the proceedings of the constitutional convention,
as well as a study of the political and governmental
bodies at the time at which the provision providing
for amending the federal Constitution was
adopted, revealed the fact that these men thought in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
terms of conventions ... <i>and that the clear intent
of the framers was to ratify proposed amendments
by bodies sitting in the capacity of conventions</i>. The
Court will not find any able exponent of the theories
of government of that time, however, <i>who even asserted
that the people could be considered as a portion
of the legislature</i>. This can be shown most clearly by
an examination of the proceedings of the constitutional
convention, as reported by Mr. Madison and particularly
by examining the various proposals advanced
in that convention for the ratification of the Constitution.”</p>

<p>We recognize immediately, in this extract from the
briefs of 1920, our own exact knowledge brought from
those “conventions.” And, when this briefer challenges
the existence of the Eighteenth Amendment on
the ground that the people who made it showed “in
Article V itself” that “the convention idea was in the
minds of the framers” and “when it came to the matter
of ratification,” a “Yes” or “No” was to be considered
by “conventions” in the various states, we are
amazed to find no upholder of the Eighteenth Amendment
replying to this attack upon its validity. The
challenge to validity again and again touches on the
monumental error of the Tory concept behind all claim
to validity. The challenge puts its finger at once upon
the absurd assumption, on which the Eighteenth
Amendment wholly depends for existence, the assumption
that the Americans we have just left ever considered
the “people” as the “legislature” or the “legislature”
as the “people.” The challenge emphasizes
the fact we all know, that the “conventions” knew that
“conventions” <i>were</i> the “people” and that “legislatures”
never were the “people.” But we are mistaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
in believing that this clear challenge was not met by
some “constitutional thinker” in his effort to uphold the
new supposed <span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> Article, made by the governments
or “legislatures” which the old “conventions” so
well knew were not the “people.” In the brief of one
champion of the new <span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> Article, we find this
clear reply to the challenge. And we notice how the
reply is not mere assertion. No one can deny the tremendous
“support,” in history and in decision and in
the Fifth Article itself, for the full reply that the Fifth
Article states definitely that “the only agency which
is authorized to ratify the Amendment is the state
legislatures!”</p>

<p>We have only one comment to make on the challenge
itself and the destructive reply to it, that the state
legislatures are the “only agent” authorized by the
Fifth Article to amend our <span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> Constitution. It
is an interesting comment. Both the challenge and the
reply are from the brief of Wheeler, counsel for the
political organization which directed that governments
make this new national government of men.</p>

<p>This Wheeler believes that the Statute of ’76 is “one
great muniment of our liberty which can never be
amended, revoked or withdrawn.” He says so in his
brief. He also maintains that his state governments,
not one of their members elected by us as citizens of
America, have omnipotent power over our every liberty,
except that they cannot change the number of
senators from each State. At one point in his brief he
“proves” overwhelmingly that the citizens of America
universally demanded his new Article, the Eighteenth
Amendment. His proof is—and we cannot deny the
fact which he asserts as proof—that, in the year 1918,
when Americans were in the Argonne Forest in France,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
four thousand seven hundred and forty-two Tories in
forty-five state legislatures said “Yes” to this new
command to the one hundred million American citizens
on a subject not among the matters enumerated in our
First Article. That his “proof” might be perfect
(for the claim that the making of the command was
demanded by the citizens of America) he fails to mention
the fact that not one of those four thousand odd
Americans, who were not the Americans in the Argonne
or in our training camps preparing to fight for
human liberty, was elected for any purpose by the
citizens of America.</p>

<p>Reflecting upon this briefer’s admiration for the
Statute of ’76 and upon his knowledge that the “legislatures”
never are the people, while the “conventions”
of the Fifth Article are the “people,” we wonder if
he ever read a certain statement of the early American
who wrote the Statute of ’76. It is a statement
from Thomas Jefferson quoted by Madison, author of
the Fifth Article, when he was urging the American
people or “conventions” to make that Fifth Article.
Jefferson was talking about a constitution, in which
“all the powers of government ... result to the
legislative body,” as they result (under the modern
assumption as to what the Fifth Article says) to the
state governments, the new omnipotent legislature of
the American people. This is what Jefferson had to
say, what Madison approved: “The concentrating
these in the same hands, is precisely the definition of
despotic government. It will be no alleviation, that
these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands,
and not by a single one. One hundred and seventy-three
despots would surely be as oppressive as
one.... As little will it avail us, that they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
chosen by ourselves. An <i>elective</i> despotism was not
the government we fought for.” (<i>Fed.</i> No. 48.)</p>

<p>It is clearly the view of Wheeler and all his associates
that the early Americans did fight their Revolution
so that we might have, in these modern days, an
elective despotism of four thousand seven hundred and
forty-two despots. That form of government is probably
relieved from the odium of the Madison and
Jefferson attack, by the “alleviation” that we ourselves,
the citizens of America, those to be governed by this
“<i>elective despotism</i>,” do not elect or choose even one
of the despots!</p>

<p>We cannot linger longer with these amazing briefs
of the champions of the Eighteenth Amendment.
From the viewpoint of unconscious humor, we have
become rather enamored of the Wheeler idea that
“state governments” and “the people of America” expressed
the same thought to the latter when they made
the Fifth Article. Since we read Wheeler’s brief, we
have been trying the same method with some famous
statements of great Americans. For example, we have
this new excerpt from Washington’s famous Farewell
Address: “The basis of our political system is the
right of the ‘state governments’ to make or alter the
people’s Constitution of government. And the Constitution
which at any time exists, till changed by an
explicit and authentic act of ‘the legislatures of three
fourths of the states’”—(Washington said ‘the whole
people’)—“is sacredly obligatory upon all.”</p>

<p>And we like particularly the improved Wheeler
concept of the rather crude Gettysburg speech of
Lincoln. In its new form, altered by the Wheeler
idea, it is wonderful to hear the appeal of Lincoln that
we, who were not among the dead at Gettysburg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
should play our part “that government of the people,
by the state governments, and for those who control
the state governments, shall not perish from the earth.”</p>

<p>We wonder if Hughes and Wheeler and Sheppard
and Webb realize how far they have gone beyond the
Calhoun idea that was repudiated forever at Gettysburg!
In the old days, the Calhoun doctrine was that
a single state, although but a political entity, could do
as it pleased <i>in its own affairs</i>, even to leaving the
Union without reference to the wishes of the citizens
of America. That question was settled forever by
the result at Gettysburg. The modern claim, the sole
claim upon which the Eighteenth Amendment depends
for existence, is that a state government, if it combines
with enough other state governments, can go outside
its own jurisdiction, outside the citizenship which chose
the legislators in it, and issue its omnipotent command
telling the citizens <i>of America</i> what <i>they</i> may do and
may not do, “in all matters whatsoever.”</p>

<p>But we leave the Court of 1920, quite satisfied that
the modern “constitutional thinkers,” who filed their
briefs therein, have not exactly the American concept
of the relation of government to human beings, which
would have located them at Valley Forge, with Marshall,
in the Winter of 1778.</p>

<p>We leave that Court, however, quite satisfied that
the Court itself still has the knowledge which Marshall
had, the knowledge stated in the Tenth Amendment
and by the decision of that Court in 1907, that all the
powers not granted by the Constitution to the general
government at Washington “are <i>reserved</i> to the
<i>people</i> and <i>can be exercised only by them or, upon
further grant from them</i>.”</p>

<p>We do not forget the question of the Court, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
question which none of the lawyers could answer, “In
what way do counsel believe that the Eighteenth
Amendment <i>could</i> be made <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONALLY</span>?”</p>

<p>We do know the answer to that question. The
Americans, in the “conventions” we just left, wrote
the answer in the Fifth Article in the words which are
the most important words in the Article and one of our
greatest securities to human liberty, “by conventions in
three fourths thereof.”</p>

<p>The “conventions” which mentioned themselves, the
“conventions,” in the Fifth Article, are the same “conventions”
which demanded that the declaration be
made that every power, not granted in that Constitution
to the government at Washington, remained
where it had been. As the state governments had been
incompetent to make the First Article or the Eighteenth
Amendment, they remained incompetent to
make either of them.</p>

<p>If we needed any assurance that the Supreme Court
still retains the accurate conceptions of these early
Americans, we find it in one of the most significant
facts in the whole remarkable story of the last five
years.</p>

<p>We do not need to recall how every lawyer dwells
continuously upon the fact that the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a
“<i>grant</i>” of power to make new Articles. We do not
need to refresh our mind with the recollection that the
Root brief referred to the Fifth Article over fifty
times as a “<i>grant</i>” of such power. We know that every
argument in every brief was based on the stated assumption
that the Fifth Article <i>was</i> a “<i>grant</i>” and that
it made the legislatures of state citizens attorneys in
fact for the citizens of America, who elect none of the
members of those legislatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span></p>

<p>Did this monumental error of all the lawyers have
any effect upon the accurate knowledge of the Supreme
Court? Did this insistence upon the absurd assumption
that the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a “<i>grant</i>,” in which “conventions”
<i>grant</i> something to themselves and to the
state governments, lead the Court into the error of
calling it a “grant?”</p>

<p>Read the conclusions of the Court, as they were
stated by Judge Van Devanter. The opening sentence
of that statement sweeps aside every assumption that
the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a “<i>grant</i>.” Can our knowledge,
brought right from the old “conventions,” be put more
completely than in the one statement: “Power to
amend the Constitution was <span class="allsmcap">RESERVED</span> by Article V.”</p>

<p>Where is the “<i>grant</i>” all the lawyers have been talking
about? Where is the “<i>grant</i>” on which the
Eighteenth Amendment depends for existence? Where
is the “<i>grant</i>” which makes the state legislatures of
state citizens attorneys in fact, for any purpose, for
the <i>American</i> citizens? Before the Constitution, in
which is the Fifth Article, there was no citizen of
America. And, as the exclusive ability of “conventions”
to make <span class="allsmcap">NATIONAL</span> Articles (like the ability of
state legislatures to make Articles which are <i>not</i>
national) “was <i>reserved</i> by Article V,” the state governments,
as imaginary attorneys for ourselves, disappear
entirely from the scene. We remain free
citizens. We have not become “subjects.”</p>

<p>This comforting knowledge is emphasized when we
find that, as the Supreme Court states its Fourth Conclusion,
again the accurate statement is that the ability
to make the new Article “is within the power to amend
<span class="allsmcap">RESERVED</span> by Article V of the Constitution.”</p>

<p>That is our own knowledge. We have brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
from the conventions, in which we have sat with the
early Americans, their knowledge that the ability of
the “conventions” to make Articles <i>of that kind</i>, their
exclusive ability to do so, was <i>reserved</i> to those “conventions,”
the assembled citizens of America. We
know that the Tenth Amendment expressly so declares.
Therefore, when <i>we</i> go to the Supreme Court, with
<i>our</i> contention that we still are citizens and that a revolution
by government against the people, a revolution
to make us “subjects,” must be repudiated by the
Supreme Court which we have established to protect
our human liberty against all usurpation by governments,
<i>our</i> challenge will be in the words of Wilson,
uttered in the Pennsylvania Convention where Americans
first set their names to the Fifth Article:</p>

<p>“How comes it, sir, that these state governments
dictate to their superiors—to the majesty of the
people?”</p>

</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The United States [the great political society of men
which this book persistently calls America] form, for many,
and for most important purposes, a single nation.... In
war, we are one people. In making peace, we are one
people. In all commercial regulations, we are one and the
same people. In many other respects, the American people
are one; and the government which is alone capable of
controlling and managing their interests in all these respects,
is the government of the Union. It is <i>their government,
and in that character they have no other</i>. America
has chosen to be, in many respects, and to many purposes,
a nation; and for all these purposes, <i>her government</i> is complete;
to all these objects, it is competent. The people have
declared that, in the exercise of all powers given <i>for these
objects</i>, it is supreme. It can, then, in effecting these
objects, legitimately control all individuals or governments
within the American territory. (U. S. Supreme Court,
Cohens v. Virginia, 6 <i>Wheat.</i> 264, at p. 413 et seq.)</p>
</div>

<p>These words of Marshall tell every American
why there is an “America,” a nation of men, in
addition to a “United States,” a federation or league
of political entities. The league existed before the
Constitution created the nation. The league was not
created by the Constitution. But the league was continued
by the Constitution in which free men created
the nation. In that Constitution, the league and its
component members (the states) were made subordinate
to the nation and <i>its</i> component members, who are
the citizens of America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span></p>

<p>How comes it, then, that modern leaders, for five
years last past, have talked their nonsense about <i>another</i>
government of the one American people? How
comes it that they have argued and acted as if the
Fifth Article <i>constituted</i> another government of the
one American people?</p>

<p>It certainly would be startling for Marshall and his
generation to hear the Eighteenth Amendment claim
that one important purpose for which Americans chose
to be one people was the purpose of enabling thirty-six
legislatures of state citizens to interfere, “in all
matters whatsoever,” with every individual liberty of
all American citizens.</p>

<p>In the light of our education with the one American
people who chose to be, “in many respects, and to many
purposes, a nation” and to have, <span class="allsmcap">IN THAT CHARACTER</span>,
no government other than the government constituted
by the First Article, how otherwise, than by the one
word “nonsense,” can we dignify the five-year discussion
as to the <i>extent</i> of the powers granted in the Fifth
Article to <i>other</i> governments, the respective governments
of the members of the league, to interfere with
the liberties of the members of the nation, the citizens
of America?</p>

<p>Citizens of America, particularly emigrants from
Europe, <i>must</i> be taught the reason <i>why</i> and the fact
<i>that</i> the one American people “were bound to have and
did at last secure” a government free from interference
by “legislatures, <i>whether representing the states</i>
or the federal government.” (Judge Parker, supra, in
Preface.)</p>

<p>Who is to teach the average citizen the reason or
the fact? Have our most renowned lawyers shown
any knowledge of either? Their own briefs have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
permitted to speak for them. Which of those briefs
has put a finger upon the basic flaw in the Eighteenth
Amendment challenge to the fact that the American
citizens “did at last secure a Government” which <i>its</i>
citizens “could control despite” all <i>legislatures</i>,
whether representing state citizens or themselves?</p>

<p>The men who wrote these briefs are far more than
lawyers of great renown. They are among the best
known leaders of public opinion in America. Many
thousands of average citizens rely upon such men to
know and state every constitutional protection to individual
liberty. In any generation, reliance upon any
public leaders for knowledge on that matter is a distinct
menace to individual liberty. The imaginary
Eighteenth Amendment will have served a useful purpose
if it teaches us that we must know <i>of our own
knowledge</i>, if we want to remain free citizens of
America.</p>

<p>“No man, let his ingenuity be what it will, could
enumerate all the individual rights not relinquished
by this Constitution.” (Iredell, later a Supreme Court
Justice, in the North Carolina convention, 4 <i>Ell. Deb.</i>
149)</p>

<p>These are the rights “retained by the people” of
America in the Ninth Amendment because not enumerated
in the First Article.</p>

<p>“If this Constitution be adopted, it must be presumed
the instrument will be in the hands of every
man in America, to see whether authority be usurped;
and any person by inspecting it may see if the power
claimed be enumerated. If it be not, he will know it
to be a usurpation.” (Iredell, in North Carolina convention,
4 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 172.)</p>

<p>All granted powers to interfere with the individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
freedom of the <i>American</i> citizen, “in that character,”
are enumerated in the First Article.</p>

<p>All powers <i>of that kind</i> not enumerated therein are
reserved in the Tenth Amendment exclusively to the
American citizens themselves to be exercised or
granted <i>by them</i> in the “conventions” of the Fifth
Article.</p>

<p>One of these powers is that which some governments
of state citizens, in the Eighteenth Amendment, have
attempted both to exercise and grant.</p>

<p>The brief of <i>which</i> public leader has known or
stated these facts to the destruction of the Amendment
and to the continued existence of the free American
citizen?</p>

<p>The experience of ages has taught that human liberty,
even in a republic, is never secure unless the
citizens of the republic themselves understand the basic
security which protects that liberty. The writer of
this book wishes to keep his own individual liberties
secure against usurpation by any government in America.
He wishes to keep his status, as such citizen, to
all governments in America—the status established by
the citizens of America through whose experience we
have been educated. He knows that such status must
end forever unless American citizens generally have
the same earnest wish and, <i>of their own knowledge</i>,
know <i>how</i> the Constitution secures that status and
their individual liberty.</p>

<p>Shortly after the American people had chosen to
be a nation with one government of enumerated powers,
there came to that then land of individual liberty
an Irish exile. Quickly he assumed his place with the
great lawyers of America. And in the year 1824 he
made clear that he would have been able to teach <i>our</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
new citizens and <i>our</i> public leaders <i>how</i> the one American
people “<i>did at last secure</i> a government” which
that one American people “could control despite” the
state legislatures. In the argument before the Supreme
Court in the famous case of Gibbons v. Ogden
(9 <i>Wheat.</i> 1, at p. 87), where his opponent was Webster,
this is how Emmett stated a fact <i>then</i> known and
“felt and acknowledged by all”:</p>

<p>“<i>The Constitution gives nothing to the states or to
the people.</i> Their rights existed before it was formed....
The Constitution <i>gives</i> only to the general
government, and, so far as it operates on the state or
popular rights, it <i>takes away</i> a portion, which it gives
to the general government.... But the states
or the people must not be thereby excluded from exercise
of any part of the sovereign or popular rights held
by them before the adoption of the Constitution except
where that instrument has given it exclusively to the
general government.” The italics are those of Emmett.</p>

<p>What does this clear statement of fact (known by
Emmett and his generation to be the exact statement
of the Tenth Amendment) make out of every argument,
whether for or against the Eighteenth Amendment,
based on the assumption that the Fifth Article
does give something to the states and their governments?
Can any American citizen doubt that it makes
clear that to describe such arguments by any other
word save “nonsense” is to lend them a dignity which
they do not possess?</p>

<p>Without a single exception, every argument during
the last five years, whether for or against the Eighteenth
Amendment, has deserved the criticism of the
Supreme Court for the fact that such argument neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
knew nor considered the meaning of the Tenth Amendment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It reads: “The powers not delegated to the United States
by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are
reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.” The
argument of counsel ignores the principal factor in this
Article, to wit, “the people.” Its principal purpose was
not the distribution of power between the United States
and the states, but a reservation to the people of all powers
not granted. The Preamble of the Constitution declares
who framed it,—“We the people of the United States,”
not the people of one state, but the people of all the states;
and Article X reserves to the people of all the states the
powers not delegated to the United States. The powers
affecting the internal affairs of the states not granted to the
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to
the states, are reserved to the states respectively, [the power
of each state for that state to its own people or citizens]
and all powers of a <i>national character</i> which are not delegated
to the national government by the Constitution are
reserved to the people of the United States [the one people
or citizens of America, that one American people which
Marshall so accurately knew]. The people who adopted
the Constitution, knew that in the nature of things they
could not forsee all the questions which might arise in the
future, all the circumstances which might call for the exercise
of further <i>national</i> powers than those granted to the
United States, and, after making provision for an Amendment
to the Constitution by which any needed additional
powers would be granted, they reserved to themselves all
powers not so delegated. (Supreme Court, Kansas v. Colorado,
1907, 206 <i>U. S.</i> 46 at p. 90.)</p>
</div>

<p>Why has every argument, for or against the new
Amendment, ignored the simple and impressive fact
that the one word “conventions” was written into the
Fifth Article and the Seventh Article by the delegates
at Philadelphia, very shortly after they had reasoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
out and reached their famous legal decision as to the
difference between the ability of “conventions” and the
ability of “state legislatures,” also named in the Fifth
Article? Why completely ignore the decisive effect of
this fact when considered with the fact, that Philadelphia
mentioned “conventions” in both Articles and
only in the Fifth mentioned “state legislatures”? If
we put ourselves exactly in the position of Philadelphia
when it was doing this, we see at once why state “legislatures”
are pointedly absent from the Seventh
Article. Philadelphia knew the nature of the First
Article, that it constituted government ability to interfere
with individual freedom. Philadelphia knew that
neither “state legislatures” nor any combination of
governments can make an Article <i>of that kind</i> in any
land where men are “citizens” and not “subjects.”
That is why “legislatures” are not mentioned in the
Seventh Article. But Philadelphia did not know the
nature of any Article which might be <i>proposed</i> at any
particular time in the future by the body which was
to perform the duty of proposing, the duty which
Philadelphia was then performing. And Philadelphia
knew that any future <i>proposed</i> Article might be of
the kind which state legislatures could make. It was
the conviction of Hamilton that <i>all</i> future <i>proposed</i>
Articles would be of the kind that “legislatures”
could make because they would be of the kind that did
not relate to “the mass of powers” to interfere with
individual liberty. That is why Philadelphia, almost
immediately after it had omitted any mention of “legislatures”
in the Seventh Article, did mention “legislatures”
in the Fifth Article, which related to the making
of future Articles whose nature Philadelphia could
not possibly know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span></p>

<p>Let us not forget what Madison told us about the
Seventh Article: “This Article speaks for itself. The
express authority of the people alone could give due
validity to the Constitution.” (<i>Fed.</i> 43.) This is his
statement that the Article itself tells us that “the express
authority of the people” <i>will</i> make the Articles
proposed from Philadelphia. How does the Article
speak for itself and tell us that? By its one word
“conventions.” Could Madison tell us more plainly
that the word “conventions,” which he and his associates
wrote into the Seventh and which he wrote into
the Fifth Article, means “the express authority of the
people”?</p>

<p>Can any supporter of the Eighteenth Amendment
find any statement from Madison in which he tells us
his word “legislatures” means what he has just told
us his word “conventions” means? And, when “conventions”
meant the “express authority of the people”
before the Fifth or Seventh Articles were written, how
could the mention of “conventions” in the Fifth imply
a grant from the “conventions” to the “conventions”?</p>

<p>Why not admit the simple truth overlooked for the
past five years? The respective mentions of “Congress,”
of “conventions” and of state “legislatures” in
the Fifth Article speak plainly of each body respectively
doing something which it could do if there were
no Fifth Article.</p>

<p>If there were no Fifth Article, could not Congress
draft an Article and <i>propose</i> it and <i>propose</i> a mode
of ratification? Philadelphia did all these things and
knew and stated that it exercised no power in doing
any of them. The mention of Congress implies no
“grant.” On the contrary, it is a command which prevents
the rest of us from making such proposals and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
prevents “conventions” or state “legislatures” from
making Articles, within their respective abilities, <i>unless</i>
proposed to them by “two thirds of both houses
of Congress.”</p>

<p>If there were no Fifth Article, could not “conventions”
make any kind of an article, as they had made
the National Articles of 1776 and as they were making
the Articles of 1787? The mention of “conventions”
implies no grant. On the contrary, it is a command
telling the “conventions” that a “Yes” from three
fourths of the “conventions” shall be necessary and
sufficient for “<i>constitutional</i>” exercise of the power
they have. It is a great security for human freedom.
It makes very difficult oppression of the people by
the people.</p>

<p>If there were no Fifth Article, could not state “legislatures”
make declaratory or <i>federal</i> Articles, which
neither exercise nor create power to interfere with
human individual freedom? They had, in 1781, made
an entire constitution of Articles <i>of that kind</i>. The
mention of “legislatures” implies no “grant.” On the
contrary it is a command to these “legislatures,” representing
the members of the union of states. The
command comes from the superiors of the states, the
“conventions” of the whole American people.</p>

<p>It is not the only command which the “conventions”
of that one people made to the states and <i>their</i> “legislatures.”
How absurd to imply from that command
that it is a “grant” of power to those commanded
governments, giving them omnipotence over every human
freedom of the American people who made the
command!</p>

<p>We know what Madison told the Americans in the
“conventions,” when he asked them to make his Fifth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
Article. He told them that it was a “mode of procedure”
in which either the general government or the
state governments could <i>originate</i>, by <i>proposal</i>, the
introduction of changes into the Constitution which is
both <i>national</i> and <i>federal</i>. He pointedly did <i>not</i> tell
those Americans that the Fifth Article is a “grant”
of any ability to the state governments to make <i>national</i>
Articles and he pointedly did <i>not</i> tell them
that it is a “grant” of ability to anyone to <i>make</i> any
Articles.</p>

<p>Why then was it necessary for the leading brief, in
support of the Eighteenth Amendment, to <i>add</i> to
Madison’s explanation of his own Fifth Article (the
explanation that it was a “mode of procedure”) the
absurd statement that it was a “grant” from the “conventions”
to the “conventions” and the state legislatures
of power <i>to make</i> Amendments? Why then was
it necessary that this brief, speaking of the Fifth
Article, should say: “The people thus ordained the
mode of Amendment,” exactly what Madison said,
“and in their own interest they established this power
of Amendment”—exactly what Madison pointedly
omitted to state to the Americans he asked to make the
Fifth Article?</p>

<p>The answer is simple. Without adding to the Madison
statement what he pointedly omitted to state,
without stating the addition as axiomatic, Hughes
could not even <i>begin</i> any argument for the Eighteenth
Amendment.</p>

<p>The statement which Hughes adds to that of Madison
is a statement which flatly contradicts everything
we have heard in the “conventions.” It flatly contradicts
everything the Americans did from 1775 on. It
flatly contradicts the Tenth Amendment declaration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
that the Fifth Article gives <i>no</i> power whatever to the
states or <i>their</i> governments. The added statement is
sheer “nonsense,” assumed and asserted as axiomatic
fact.</p>

<p>And, during the last five years, how has every argument
against the Eighteenth Amendment met the “nonsense”
of the assumption that the Fifth Article is a
“grant?” In no way at all, except by assuming and
asserting the same “nonsense,” and by then undertaking
to prove another absurdity, namely, that the Fifth
Article does not <i>relate</i> to the making of fundamental
changes <i>because</i> the imaginary “grant” is limited in
extent and does not include power to take away from
the importance of the respective political entities which
are the states.</p>

<p>Let no American citizen make any mistake as to this
one fact. In no argument either for or against the
Eighteenth Amendment has there been any challenge
to the sheer assumption that the Fifth Article is a
“grant” of ability to make changes in the Constitution
which is both <i>federal</i> and <i>national</i>. On the contrary,
in every argument, the foundation of everything asserted
and urged is that very assumption.</p>

<p>In every argument against the Eighteenth Amendment,
possible changes in the Constitution (which is
both federal and national) have been divided into two
classes, but not into the federal class and the national
class. It has been invariably contended that the first
class include those which <i>can</i> be made under the imaginary
“grant” of power in the Fifth Article and in the
mode of procedure therein prescribed. On the other
hand, it has been invariably contended that the other
class includes those which <i>cannot</i> be made under that
imaginary “grant” or in <i>any</i> <span class="allsmcap">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> procedure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
<i>because</i> they take away from the citizens <i>of a
state</i> their right to govern themselves.</p>

<p>All arguments alike, whether for or against the
Eighteenth Amendment, have wholly ignored the fact
that the citizens of <i>America</i>, for the protection of the
individual liberty of the one American people, <span class="allsmcap">IN THAT
CHARACTER</span>, established the Constitution and made it
the supreme law over the citizens of the respective
states and the states themselves and the state governments
and the league of the states, which the citizens
of America continued as subordinate to their nation of
men.</p>

<p>For this reason probably, no argument, on either
side, has ever recognized the identity of the “conventions”
of the Seventh Article with the “conventions”
of the Fifth Article. For this reason probably, no
argument has ever recognized the identity of both
“conventions” with the most important factor and reservee
in the Tenth Amendment, “the people” of
America, as distinguished from the lesser reservees,
the peoples or citizens of each state, “the states respectively.”</p>

<p>It is this very failure to recognize this identity which
has forced the opponents of the new Amendment into
the “nonsense” of assuming and asserting, with their
adversaries, that the Fifth Article <i>is</i> a “grant” to the
“conventions” and the state “legislatures.” If there
had not been this failure, everyone would have recognized
that the “conventions,” which made the Constitution,
neither could nor did “grant” to themselves,
the “conventions” named in the Fifth Article, any or
all of the very power which they were then exercising.
The “nonsense” of the concept of such a “grant” is
patent once there is recognized the identity between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
the “conventions” with the most important reservee of
the Tenth Amendment, the one American people of
Marshall.</p>

<p>We all know that, for five years, that identity has
never been known or mentioned. The failure to know
or to mention it has been emphasized by the occasional
references to “conventions” which have been made.
In one or two arguments, there has been passing attempt
to support the “nonsense,” that the Fifth Article
is a “grant,” but a “grant” limited in extent, by a
suggestion that the Eighteenth Amendment could be
“grafted” on the Constitution entirely outside of any
mode of procedure <i>mentioned</i> in the Constitution. The
suggestion has been that it could be “grafted” on the
Constitution by “conventions” of the citizens <i>of each
state</i>, provided that the citizens of <i>every</i> state gave
their consent. In these suggestions, we ourselves, the
citizens <i>of America</i>, the whole American people of
Marshall, have figured not at all.</p>

<p>We, who <i>are</i> the citizens of America, must now
realize the vital importance to our personal liberty of
our own knowledge that we are citizens of America as
well as citizens of some particular state. Wilson
pointed out to the Americans in the Pennsylvania convention
the dual capacity of the American, if the new
Constitution were adopted. We remember his statement
that “it was necessary to observe the two-fold
relation in which the people would stand—first as
citizens of the general government and, secondly, as
citizens of their particular state. The general government
was meant for them in the first capacity; the
state governments in the second. Both governments
were derived from the people; both meant for the
people; both therefore ought to be regulated on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
same principles.” And we remember the one most
important American principle, that every government
in America must get, directly from its own citizens,
every power to interfere with their individual freedom.</p>

<p>We cannot help contrasting the accurate statement
of Wilson, “in this Constitution the citizens of America
appear dispensing a portion of their power,” with
what must be the modern statement, if the Eighteenth
Amendment is in the Constitution, namely, “in this
Constitution the <i>state governments</i> appear dispensing
to themselves and to the national government another
portion of the power of the citizens of America.”</p>

<p>And, if that modern statement is “nonsense,” what
else but “nonsense” are the arguments which rely upon
its truth or which do not point out its absurdity?</p>

<p>What action of <i>our</i> public leaders, even in this year
1923, does not disclose that they still have the Tory
concept that states and their governments, both of
which are political entities, <i>can</i> exercise or grant power
which the Tenth Amendment expressly declares that
the American citizens reserved exclusively to themselves,
and which the Supreme Court, even as late as
1907, clearly held “could be exercised only by them or
upon further grant from them?” No discerning American
has failed to note that the Senate still clings to
the delusion of 1917, that states and <i>their</i> citizens and
<i>their</i> governments have anything whatever to do with
the <i>national</i> part of the Constitution of the citizens
of America. In the newspapers, on January 30, 1923,
under the heading, “Favor New Defense for Constitution,”
appeared a dispatch from Washington. It
told how the senators on the Judiciary Sub-Committee
had agreed to report favorably a proposal again to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
amend the Constitution by changing the language of
the Fifth Article. And the main element of the proposed
change is to provide that any state may require
that ratification by its legislature be subject to confirmation
by popular vote of the citizens <i>of that state</i>.</p>

<p>The citizens of each state make their own Constitution.
In it, they give to their own government what
ability they please to interfere with their own individual
freedom. What have the citizens <i>of any
State</i>, what have the citizens <i>of every state</i>, in their
capacity <i>as state citizens</i>, to do with grants of power
to the American government to interfere with the individual
liberty of the <i>American</i> citizens? Have not
the <i>American</i> citizens, in <i>every</i> state, protection against
grants of <i>such</i> power to the one government of the
<i>American</i> people except by the citizens <i>of America</i>
themselves, <i>in that character</i>? Is there anything in the
Fifth Article, as it was written by Madison and made
by the one American people, which permits any state
governments—which have no power even over their
own respective citizens except by grant from them—to
exercise or create new government power to interfere
with the liberty of the citizens of the distinct and
supreme nation, America?</p>

<p>Why persistently and insistently ignore the basic
American legal principle that every state government
must get its own power over its own citizens from
them and that the only government of the American
citizens must get its every <i>national</i> (as distinguished
from <i>federal</i>) power directly from the citizens <i>of
America</i>, assembled in the “conventions” named in the
Fifth Article?</p>

<p>Is there any doubt that Madison, who wrote the
Fifth Article, knew whom its word “conventions” described?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
When he asked the one American people to
make the entire Constitution, this is what he told them
about the Seventh Article, in which the same word
“conventions” was used: “This Article speaks for itself.
The express authority of the people alone could
give due validity to the Constitution.” If the Seventh
Article “speaks for itself” and points out that “the
people alone” are to make the Constitution, with its
grants of <i>national</i> power in the First Article, what
word in that Seventh Article identifies the makers of
the Constitution, which Madison and all Americans
know was made by the <i>one people</i> of America? Is
there any word in it except the one word “conventions”
to describe the people or citizens of America? And
if that one word “conventions” makes the Article speak
for itself and tell us that the American citizens themselves
made the whole Constitution, does not the word
“conventions” in the Fifth Article speak just as plainly
for itself and tell us that it also describes and identifies
the one people of America, the citizens of
America?</p>

<p>Why then tinker with the Fifth Article and repeat
the monumental error on which the existence of the
Eighteenth Amendment is assumed? Why propose an
Amendment to the Fifth Article, which Amendment
will itself assume that the Fifth Article already is a
“grant” to the state legislatures of ability to give away
from the citizens of America their exclusive power to
say to what extent and in what matters their one
American government may interfere with their individual
freedom in their character as American citizens?</p>

<p>Why not be sane and admit that the Fifth Article
is not a “grant” to the legislatures of state citizens?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
It is settled fact that each such legislature, like every
legislature in America, must get its every power to
govern its own citizens <i>from</i> its own citizens. That is
why the Fourth Article guarantee of “a Republican
Form of Government” to every state has taught us
(pp. 250-1) the absurdity of the thought that the Fifth
Article enables state governments outside Rhode Island
to give its government power to interfere with the individual
freedom of citizens of Rhode Island. And
there is a further and more monumental absurdity, in
this same respect, when we contrast this Fourth Article
guarantee with the assumption that the Fifth Article
is a “grant” to the state legislatures. One of the great
purposes for which the whole American people made
themselves one nation of men was that the strength of
such a great nation might be used to secure to the
Americans in every state the ability to govern themselves
without any interference from outside the state,
in all matters except those in which the citizens of
America took from them the ability to govern themselves.
That is why the citizens of America wrote
that guarantee into the Fourth Article as a command
to their inferiors, the states and the state governments.
Having thus secured “a Republican Form of Government”
to the Americans in every state by the command
of the Fourth Article, is it conceivable that the same
whole American people, immediately thereafter and
in the Fifth Article, created for the citizens of America
a government which has not even the semblance of “a
Republican Form of Government”? That is the concept
on which the existence of the Eighteenth Amendment
depends. It is not in the Constitution unless,
immediately after the guarantee of the Fourth Article
and <i>in</i> the Fifth Article, the whole people of America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
said: “We have just insisted that the Americans in
each state must be governed by a government which
gets its power directly from them. For ourselves,
however, as the whole American people, we are content
to let two thirds of Congress and the legislatures
of three fourths of the states interfere with our individual
freedom, in all matters whatsoever. For
that reason, we make this grant to those legislatures.
For ourselves, as one people, we have no desire for
a Republican Form of Government.”</p>

<p>Does not the claim that the Americans did say this
in their Fifth Article entitle us more justly than Henry
to exclaim: “I suppose that I am mad, or that my
countrymen are so!” (3 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 446.)</p>

<p>We know, with certainty, that the Eighteenth
Amendment is not in our Constitution, and we know
that the real and invincible challenge to its existence
has never been made. What will be the epitaph of
the audacious attempt of government to dictate to
Americans as “subjects,” when the challenge is presented
to the Supreme Court? No patriotic American
can have the slightest doubt. No man, familiar with
its history and traditions, can fail to know the answer
of that Court to the question, “Citizen or Subject?”</p>

<p>It is not unknown that there is growing up in America,
even among many public leaders and lawyers, an
unfounded concept that the Supreme Court was created
by the American citizens <i>to make</i> law. Such concept
is quite in accord with the concept—indeed it is part
of the concept—that government can create and constitute
new government of men. But the entire history
and tradition of the Supreme Court flatly denies the
existence of any such concept in the mind of the Court
itself. Even in the National Prohibition Cases, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
Court quickly displayed the American concept of the
relation of men to all governments in America. When
the lawyers had finished their incessant talk about the
imaginary Fifth Article “grant” which would make all
American citizens “subjects” of some governments of
state citizens, had the Tory concept of such a grant
made the slightest impression upon the mind of the
Court? We all know that in the decisions, which
merely negatived four unsound challenges to the
Amendment, the first statement of the Court was a
reference to the power “<span class="allsmcap">RESERVED</span>” in the Fifth
Article.</p>

<p>And we know how, in the same litigations, the Court
wholly ignored the absurd claim, even when advanced
by a former justice of the Court, that, when governments
had attempted to put anything into our Constitution,
so long as the attempt did not involve changing
the number of senators from a state, the Court was
without power to review the action of governments or
to protect the American citizen against usurpation by
government.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Constitution is not only the same in words, but the
same in meaning, and delegates the same powers to the
government, and reserves and secures the same rights and
privileges to the citizen, and as long as it continues to
exist in its present form, it speaks not only in the same
words, but with the same meaning and intent with which
it spoke when it came from the hands of its framers and
was voted on and adopted <i>by the people of the United
States</i>. Any other rule of construction would abrogate
the judicial character of the Court, and make it the mere
reflex of the popular opinion or passion of the day. This
Court was not created by the Constitution for such purposes.
Higher and graver trusts have been confided to it,
and it must not falter in the path of duty. (Scott v. Sandford,
19 <i>How.</i> 393, at p. 426.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span></p>

<p>The high power has been conferred upon this Court of
passing judgment upon the acts of the state sovereignties
and of the legislative and executive branches of the federal
government, of determining whether they are beyond the
limits of power marked out for them respectively by the
Constitution of the United States. (Luther v. Borden,
1849, 7 <i>How.</i> 1 at p. 47.)</p>
</div>

<p>The Court will never be called upon to exercise a
higher or graver trust than to answer the question
“Citizen or Subject?”, when the real challenge is made
to the new attempted constitution of government of
men entirely by government. The Court is not unaware
that the whole American people established
their Constitution for the one purpose of protecting
individual liberty.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The simple, classical, precise, yet comprehensive language
in which it is couched, leaves, at most, but very little latitude
for construction; and when its intent and meaning is
discovered, nothing remains but to execute the will of those
who made it, in the best manner to effect the purposes
intended. The great and paramount purpose was to unite
this mass of wealth and power, for the protection of the
humblest individual; his rights, civil and political, his
interests and prosperity, are the sole <i>end</i>; the rest are nothing
but the <i>means</i>. (Justice Johnson, Gibbons v. Ogden,
9 <i>Wheat.</i> 1, at p. 223.)</p>
</div>

<p>Nor will anyone familiar with the unbroken tradition
of the Supreme Court listen, with aught but
mingled incredulity and indignation, to the suggestion
that the Court itself has not always understood that
it is itself but a part of the <i>limited</i> government of the
one American people, created by that people as one
means to that sole end.</p>

<p>“It is emphatically the province and duty of the
Judiciary Department to say what the law <i>is</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span></p>

<p>This is the clear statement of Marshall in Marbury
v. Madison, 1 <i>Cranch.</i> 137, declaring unconstitutional
a section of an act of Congress, which had been passed
at the first session in 1789. The entire Bench and Bar
of America, including the Supreme Court, for fourteen
years, had practiced on the assumption that the section
was constitutional. Yet in 1803, the Supreme Court
declared it to be unconstitutional. Nothing could more
clearly establish the knowledge of the Supreme Court
that no continued thought (even by the Court itself),
that any command of legislatures is valid, will ever
blind the Court to its bounden duty to announce the
fact that the command was made without authority
from the people, when that fact is once made clear to
the Court.</p>

<p>Exactly the same attitude was taken by the Court
in relation to an income tax and a <i>federal</i> limitation
on a <i>national</i> power given to impose direct taxation.</p>

<p>When that federal limitation was imposed it was
aimed only at taxation on land and at what were then
known as “poll” or “capitation” taxes. In the days
of the “conventions” where we have sat, all other
kinds of taxation were deemed to be indirect taxation.</p>

<p>In the very early days of the Supreme Court, this
knowledge of the “convention” days was echoed in
decisions which, <i>on that ground</i>, held that certain
taxes, which today might be regarded as direct taxation,
were not within the federal limitation as to apportionment
of direct taxes among the states. Among
those taxes, those imposed without apportionment,
were a tax on carriages and receipts of insurance companies
and on the inheritance of real estate. Even as
late as the days of the Civil War, when a tax was imposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
upon incomes and without apportionment among
states, the Supreme Court held that such tax was not
a direct tax within the meaning of “direct tax” to
those who imposed the federal limitation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the income tax law of 1894 had
been enacted, its opponents again carried to the Supreme
Court the claim that it violated the federal limitation
on the power of direct taxation, because it did
not apportion the tax among the states. And the Supreme
Court, by a divided vote and on the ground that
a tax on the income from land was a tax on the land
itself and consequently a direct tax, held the Income
Tax Law of 1894 to be void. It was by reason of
this decision that the Sixteenth Amendment was proposed
and adopted, making the <i>federal</i> change in the
Constitution that lifted the <i>federal</i> limitation from the
national power of direct taxation insofar as a tax on
incomes was concerned.</p>

<p>In these decisions, as in the many others which have
followed the same clear American concept of duty and
power, the Supreme Court has always known and followed
the reason stated by Hamilton for its existence
as part of the <i>limited</i> government of the one American
people.</p>

<p>In <i>Federalist</i>, Nos. 78 and 81, appealing to the
Americans to make the Constitution, Hamilton points
out that the Constitution does not authorize the Supreme
Court to exercise its will to make the law what
the Court thinks it <i>ought to be</i>, but does impose upon
the Court the duty of exercising its judgment to ascertain
what the law <i>has been made</i> by those competent to
make it. And then he points out that the Supreme
Court, in this Constitution of a self-governing people,
is made the great bulwark of the people against legislative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
encroachment upon the rights or powers of the
people reserved to themselves.</p>

<p>This knowledge of Hamilton has been the knowledge
of the Supreme Court from its institution. It has
been reiterated and explained and expounded in that
Court from the days of Marshall to our own day. It
has become part and parcel of the great traditions of
that Court, which are the foundation of the great respect
which the average American citizen pays to its
decisions and its authority as his own great protection
against usurpation of power by other departments of
his various governments.</p>

<p>And so the average American citizen will look forward
with certainty to the decision of that Court when
the <i>real</i> challenge is made to the existence of the Eighteenth
Amendment by an American who does know
and assert the plain facts which mean that either there
is no Eighteenth Amendment or there never has been
an American citizen. It <i>is</i> simple fact that the existence
of the Eighteenth Amendment, that government-made
constitution of government of men, is absolutely
incompatible with the existence of a citizen of America.
It <i>is</i> simple fact that the Fifth Article did not grant
to state governments or to any governments the ability
to make Articles like the First Article or the Eighteenth
Amendment, or else the Fifth Article made all
Americans “subjects” of a part of the state governments,
with omnipotent ability in those governments
to legislate for Americans “in all matters whatsoever.”</p>

<p>And it is simple fact that the Supreme Court must
and will—when the real challenge is at last made—decide
that the Eighteenth Amendment is not in the
<i>national</i> part of the American Constitution because it
was made by governments and not by the “conventions”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
of the Fifth Article. Otherwise, in the face of
history, in the face of the record of the “conventions”
of the American citizens, and in the face of all that
the Supreme Court has hitherto decided, the Court
must decide that the American citizen has never existed.
The possibility that there should be such a decision
is absolutely beyond conception.</p>

<p>What the decision <i>will</i> be was long ago foreshadowed
and forecast by Daniel Webster. It would almost
seem as if Webster had heard the Sheppard claim
that the states made the Constitution and that the
states had then agreed between themselves that the
governments of thirty-six of the states, in combination,
could command the American citizen in any matter of
his individual freedom. It would almost seem as if
Webster had heard Hughes deny, while his associate
lawyers for the Eighteenth Amendment still asserted
with Sheppard, that the Constitution was a compact
between states and then had heard them all insist that
the Fifth Article was a “grant” which made thirty-six
governments of state citizens an omnipotent Parliament
over all citizens of America.</p>

<p>“When the gentleman says, the Constitution is a
compact between the states, he uses language exactly
applicable to the old Confederation. He speaks as
if he were in Congress before 1789. He describes
fully that old state of things then existing. The Confederation
was, in strictness, a compact; the states, as
states, were parties to it. We had no other general
government. But that was found insufficient, and inadequate
to the public exigencies. The <i>people</i> were
not satisfied with it, and undertook to establish a better.
<i>They</i> undertook to form a general government
which would stand on a new basis—not a confederacy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
not a league, not a compact between states, but a constitution;
a popular government, founded in popular
election, directly responsible to the people themselves,
and divided into branches, with prescribed <i>limits of
power</i>, and prescribed duties. <i>They</i> ordained such a
government; <i>they</i> gave it the name of a constitution;
and therein <i>they</i> established a distribution of powers
between this, their general government, and their several
state governments. When <i>they</i> shall have become
dissatisfied with this distribution, <i>they</i> can alter it.
<i>Their own power over their own instrument remains.</i>
But until <i>they</i> shall alter it, it must stand as <i>their</i> will,
and is equally binding on the general government and
on the states.” (Webster’s concluding remarks in the
reply to Hayne, 4 <i>Ell. Deb.</i> 518.)</p>

<p>Is not the same doctrine certain from the Court
which knew the whole Constitution so well that it
decided, in the important case of Barron v. Mayor of
Baltimore, supra, p. 376, that the entire Constitution
gave no power of any kind to the state governments?
Is not the same doctrine certain from the Court which
held:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The powers the people have given to the General Government
are named in the Constitution, and all not there
named, either expressly or by implication, are reserved to
the people, and can be exercised only by them, or upon further
grant from them. (Turner v. Williams, 194 <i>U. S.</i>
279 at 296.)</p>
</div>

<p>When the real challenge to the Eighteenth Amendment
is presented before that Court, it will be necessary
for the defenders of the Amendment to abandon
the disguise in which they attempt to conceal the real
nature of their Tory concept. No one of them has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
been bold enough to state in words the real claim about
the Fifth Article. That real claim is that the Article
is a “grant” and that the “grant” gives to thirty-six
governments of state citizens unrestricted ability to
interfere with the freedom of the American citizen on
every subject enumerated in the First Article and on
every subject not enumerated in the First Article.
That is not the way any defender of the Amendment
states his claim. It is always stated that those thirty-six
governments can change the Constitution by putting
into it anything which the American citizens, assembled
in their “conventions,” can put into it. Our education
with the Americans in the “conventions” has taught
us that both statements are exactly the same statement.
If the thirty-six state governments can make
the command to the American citizens which is embodied
in the First Section of the Eighteenth Amendment,
by putting that command into the <i>national</i> part
of our Constitution, any thirty-six state legislatures can
make any command to the American citizens on any
subject enumerated or not enumerated in the First
Article. The claim, that the Fifth Article “grants” to
the thirty-six state governments the right to put the
command in the Constitution, is identical with the
claim that the Fifth Article “grants” to the state governments
the right to make the command to the citizens
of America. A legislative command to human
beings, interfering with their individual freedom, is a
legislative command by whatever name it may be
called. Mere omission to call a legislative command
by the usual names, an “Act” or “Statute,” cannot
alter its essential nature.</p>

<p>From June 21st, 1788, the birthday of the American
nation of men, there has been but one possible answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
to the question which is the title of this book. That
one answer was known to everyone in the “conventions”
which made the Fifth Article. The Americans
in those conventions all knew that they were becoming
“citizens” of America, not “subjects” of any governments.
They knew that they were dispensing part of
the power of the American citizens to Congress in the
First Article; <i>and that the rest of that power they
were reserving to themselves</i>. They knew that they
were giving no power whatever to the state governments
with whom <i>they</i> never deal except to command
those governments.</p>

<p>That is why Pendleton, in the Virginia convention,
made his statement of fact in the oratorical form of a
question, because the one answer to the question was
known and “felt and acknowledged by all.” His statement
of fact, made in the oratorical form of a question,
is, in substance, exactly the title of this book:</p>

<p>“Who but the people can delegate powers?...
What have the state governments to do with it?” (3
<i>Ell. Deb.</i> 37.)</p>

STATES</span></h3>
</div>


<p>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more
perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility,
provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare,
and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,
do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United
States of America.</p><h4>Article. I.</h4>

<p>Section, 1. All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested
in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a
Senate and House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Section. 2. The House of Representatives shall be composed
of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the
several States, and the Electors in each State shall have <sup>the</sup>
Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous
Branch of the State Legislature.</p>

<p>No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained
to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years
a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected,
be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.</p>

<p>Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among
the several States which may be included within this Union,
according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined
by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including
those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians
not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual
Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first
Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every
subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall
by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed
one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be

three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations
one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four,
Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten,

other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.</p>

<p>Section. 3. The Senate of the United States shall be composed
of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature
thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.</p>

<p>Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of
the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be
into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class
shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the
second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the
third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one
third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies
happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the
Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary
Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature,
which shall then fill such Vacancies.</p>

<p>No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to
the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the
United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant
of that State for which he shall be chosen.</p>

<p>The Vice President of the United States shall be President
of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally
divided.</p>

<p>The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President
pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or
when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United
States.</p>

<p>The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.
When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or
Affirmation. When the President of the United States <sup>is tried</sup>
the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members
present.</p>

<p>Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further
than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and
enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United
States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and
subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according
to Law.</p>

<p>Section. 4. The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections
for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in
each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may
at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as
to the Places of chusing Senators.</p>

<p>The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year,
and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December,
unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.</p>

<p>Section. 5. Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections,
Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority
of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller
Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized
to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner,
and under such Penalties as each House may provide.</p>

<p>Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,
punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the
Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.</p>

<p>Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and
from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as
may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and
Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall,
at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the
Journal.</p>

<p>Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without
the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days,
nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses
shall be sitting.</p>

Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law,
and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They
shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the
Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at
the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in
either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.</p>

<p>No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for
which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under
the Authority of the United States, which shall have been
created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased
during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the
United States, shall be a Member of either House during his
Continuance in Office.</p>

<p>Section. 7. All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the
House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur
with Amendments as on other Bills.</p>

<p>Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives
and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be
presented to the President of the United States; If he approve
he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his
Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who
shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed
to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of
that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together
with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall
likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that
House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the
Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays,
and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill
shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If
any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten
Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented
to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had
signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its
Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.</p>

<p>Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence
of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary
(except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to
the President of the United States; and before the Same shall
take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by
him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House
of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed
in the Case of a Bill.</p>

Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the
Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:</p>

<p>Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature
thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole
Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State
may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative,
or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under
the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.</p>

<p>The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote

an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they
shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the
Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and
certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of
the United States, directed to the President of the Senate.
The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate
and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and
the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest
Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be
a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if
there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an
equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall
immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if
no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President.
But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by
States, the Representation from each State having one Vote;
A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or
Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all
the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after
the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest
Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President.
But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes,
the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President.</p>

<p>The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors,
and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which
Day shall be the same throughout the United States.</p>

<p>No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the
United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution,
shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any
Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to
the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident
within the United States.</p>

<p>In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or
of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers
and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the
Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the
Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the
President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then
act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until
the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.</p>

<p>The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services,
a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished
during the Period for which he shall have been elected,
and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument
from the United States, or any of them.</p>

<p>Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take
the following Oath or Affirmation:—“I do solemnly swear (or
affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of
the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”</p>

<p>Section. 2. The President shall be Commander in Chief of the
Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the
several States, when called into the actual Service of the
United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any
Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he
shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences
against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.</p>

<p>He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent
of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the
Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with
the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors,
other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme
Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments
are not herein otherwise provided for, and which
shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest
the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper,
in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads
of Departments.</p>

<p>The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that
may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions
which shall expire at the End of their next Session.</p>

<p>Section. 3. He shall from time to time give to the Congress
Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their
Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and
expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both
Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between
them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may
adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall
receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take
Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission
all the Officers of the United States.</p>

and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Controversies to which the United
States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more
States;—between a State and Citizens of another State;—between
Citizens of different States,—between Citizens of the same
State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between
a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States,

and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.</p>

<p>The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment,

the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed
within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or
Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.</p>

attainted.</p><h4>Article. IV.</h4>

<p>Section. 1. Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State

<p>A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or
other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another
State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the
State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to
the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.</p>
